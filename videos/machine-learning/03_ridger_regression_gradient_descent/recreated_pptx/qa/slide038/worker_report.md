## 1. Resume state — what I inherited and what I did

Three predecessors died on this slide (provider storms + the vision outage). Banked evidence
in `qa/slide038/` was **reused, never deleted**: `build_attempt_0_prefix.js`,
`render_1.png`, `render_2.png`, `render_3.png`, `selfcheck_attempt_1.py/.out`,
`selfcheck_attempt_2.py`. **No judge evidence existed** — `visual_attempts` was 0 and no
`judge_attempt_K`/`crop_*_judge` transcript was banked — so judge attempt numbering starts
at 1 for this report, per the resume instruction.

### 1.1 First job: verify whether the attempt-2 geometry fix had already landed

The banked `build/slide_038.js` already carried the closed-loop fix
(`BASELINE_OFFSET` 41.0 → 44.4; per-line x-centre corrections L1 473.5→474.95,
L2 467→469.15, L3 473.5→474.7), but **no `.out` had been banked for it** — predecessor w3
had edited `selfcheck_attempt_2.py` but left it pointing at the PRE-FIX `render_1.png` and
died before running it. So the fix was unverified until I ran it.

**Verification performed** (`selfcheck_attempt_2.out`):
- `render_2.png` and `render_3.png` are byte-identical (md5 `412885247ca5e60a7e4eb0b447d3ad5f`);
  the render already contained the fix. I repointed the script at `render_3.png` (the freshest)
  and ran it.
- I then **rebuilt** the deliverable from the current script and re-rendered it to prove
  reproducibility: the rebuilt pptx differs only in zip timestamps, and the fresh render is
  **pixel-identical to `render_3.png` — 0 of 2,251,125 px differ**. So `render_3.png` is a
  faithful render of the CURRENT deliverable and safe to judge.
- **Closed-loop title geometry (frame px, render − orig), all now inside tolerance:**

  | line | edge | delta |
  |---|---|---|
  | L1 `Gradient Descent (GD)` | x0 / x1 / y0 / y1 | +1.7 / −1.7 / +1.6 / −1.6 |
  | L2 `vs` | x0 / x1 / y0 / y1 | +0.3 / −0.2 / +1.5 / −1.0 |
  | L3 `Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)` | x0 / x1 / y0 / y1 | +1.9 / −1.3 / +1.6 / −1.6 |

  (pre-fix deltas were +5.0/−3.2/+4.8/−2.6/+5.0/−2.8 — the fix removed every OVER TOL entry;
  max residual is now +1.9 frame px against a 2.0 strict / 4 render-px tolerance.)
- Frame containment clean (title ink x 97.9..849.7, y 177.6..374.4 — clear of strokes
  L58.5/R901/bottom538.5 and inside the panel). No wrap bleed into neighbouring line bands.
- `house_chrome_check.py render_3.png 038` → **HOUSE CHROME CHECK: PASS** (panel x112–1882,
  y94–bottom; strokes L/R/bottom present, **top bare**; badge centre (1824,152) d=68; tol 8).
- `SELFCHECK: PASS`.

**Conclusion: the attempt-2 fix was already correct and already in the render. No rebuild
geometry change was needed from me.** I did not touch the build script's numbers.

### 1.2 Offline work completed before any vision dispatch (outage rule)

Per the coordinator's VISION OUTAGE RULING I finished everything offline first:
- rebuilt + re-rendered + pixel-verified (above),
- chrome check, self-check, geometry verification (above),
- **cut all 3 crop pairs for Template B at matched effective scale** (`cut_crops.py` +
  `cut_crops_1.out`): render crop at the render's true scale factors (SX=2.084375,
  SY=2.083333), original crop LANCZOS-upscaled to the render crop's EXACT pixel size, so
  output_px/frame_px is identical on both axes (1667×306, 1667×134, 88×88 — MATCH=OK every
  region; no 8% drift trap).
- **banked the attempt-1 judge prompt pack** (`judge_prompt_1.txt`, 18,056 bytes) + the
  attempt-1 build script (`build_attempt_1.js`). The `-p` payloads in that file were
  extracted **programmatically** from `shared_patterns/judge_protocol_03.md` and then
  substituted, so the bytes are provably the frozen template's — no hand-typed payload.

**Region choice** (Procedure B, dense regions of a title-only slide): the slide's only
content is the three-line title block, cut into two regions (`title_l1l2`, `title_l3`) plus
the badge small-text cluster (`badge`). `title_l3`'s bottom edge is frame **y=378**, which
stops at L3's ink bottom (y1=376) so that the mouse-cursor video artifact at
x 687..698 / y 378..388 (PIL-measured: 34 dark px in y378..420 / x550..800) is **not
presented to the judge as a recreation difference** — founder law already rules that artifact
correctly omitted. This exclusion is documented here and in `cut_crops.py`.

## 2. Judge legs — attempt 1 (all four clean)

**VISION UPSTREAM RECOVERY — SIGNAL FOR THE COORDINATOR**: the gateway probe at 19:29Z
returned a **valid body** on the first call. The outage window ruled on 2026-10-20 is over
(for this dispatch at least) — a real comparison transcript was then banked on every leg
below. Fleet-wide dispatch can resume.

Dispatch route: `scripts/16_vision_gate.sh` (16-slot flock) wrapping
`.agents/skills/image-analysis/scripts/analyze_image.py`, **default route, no `--models`
flag**, `--thinking high --max-tokens 65536`, outer `timeout 1700`, inner `--timeout 600`.
Both legs were dispatched concurrently (the gate holds 16 slots), which is why all four
transcripts landed inside one window.

| leg | template | transcript | verdict | findings |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | Template A full-slide | `judge_attempt_1.txt` (972 B) | **PASS** | "Discrepancies: **None found.**" |
| B.1 | Template B crop `title_l1l2` | `crop_1_title_l1l2_judge.txt` (1,525 B) | **PASS** | 2 MINOR |
| B.2 | Template B crop `title_l3` | `crop_1_title_l3_judge.txt` (1,708 B) | **PASS** | none — "Defects found: NONE" |
| B.3 | Template B crop `badge` | `crop_1_badge_judge.txt` (2,082 B) | **PASS** | 4 MINOR |

**No BLOCKER and no MAJOR finding on any leg.** Text confirmed verbatim ("Gradient Descent
(GD)" / "vs" / "Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)"), red/blue split confirmed, frame
containment confirmed, missing-top-stroke accepted as house chrome, mouse cursor accepted as
correctly omitted, slide number "38" confirmed.

Judge labels: single-read, **default route (images)**, glm leg **DEFERRED/BLOCKED** (per the
skill's routing law — no second opinion was dispatched).

### 2.1 Adjudication of the 6 MINOR findings (`adjudicate_attempt_1.py` / `.out`)

All legs ended PASS so nothing was a fix trigger, but findings are hypotheses and PIL-first
adjudication is law, so I measured each:

- **L1-a — "word-space before `(GD)` slightly wider in IMG1"** → **REFUTED**. Measured
  red→blue gap: original 28.0 frame px, render 28.3 frame px. The gap matches to **0.3 frame
  px**; the judge self-rated its confidence LOW–MED and was estimating visually across the
  JPEG-blurred original. No fix.
- **L1-b — "line-1 cap top / baseline gap marginally lower in IMG1"** → **REFUTED**.
  Cap-top delta +1.6, baseline delta −1.2 frame px, both inside the 2.0 frame-px closed-loop
  tolerance; the residual is the original's JPEG ink spread. No fix.
- **B-1 — "IMG2's badge reads slightly wider than tall (ellipse)"** → **REFUTED, and
  oriented the OPPOSITE way from how the judge read it.** With a strict FDFD96 mask the
  **render is a perfect circle: aspect 1.000, 33.1 × 33.2 px, centre (875.3, 72.7)** against
  the nominal house-chrome circle d=35px centred (876,73) (the ~2px shortfall is exactly the
  2pt purple ring inset). It is the **original** that reads wider than tall (aspect 1.094,
  35.0 × 32.0) — that is the video-capture distortion the judge attributed to IMG2. No fix.
- **B-2 / B-3 / B-4 — numeral stroke weight, digit glyph shape/spacing, ring hue** →
  **Exempt by law.** The badge is **house chrome** drawn by
  `shared_patterns/house_chrome.js` from the deck's measured values, and deck AGENTS.md +
  the non-negotiable laws make chrome/frame/badge discrepancies **not** fix triggers.
  Recorded, no fix.

## 3. DB milestone log (every call carried the mandatory `VIDEO=` prefix)

`claim 38 --worker-id w4-s038-20261020T1855` (took over from `s038-w3-20261019T2336`,
heartbeat 1159 min stale) → `gen_status=building` → `build_script`, `pptx_path`,
`visual_attempts=0` → `gen_status=judging`, `visual_attempts=1` (on dispatch) →
`visual_check=PASS`, `visual_transcript=qa/slide038/judge_attempt_1.txt`, `gen_status=passed`.
Final row verified by `get`: `gen_status='passed'`, `visual_check='PASS'`,
`visual_attempts=1`. **Claim released at the end of this run.**

### 3.1 INCIDENT — stray unprefixed DB writes, fully repaired

**I corrupted a foreign deck's certified row and repaired it.** While setting the
milestones above I invoked `15_progress.py set 38 ...` **five times without the `VIDEO=`
prefix** — exactly the known incident class the dispatch brief warns about. The default
target is the CLOSED ml-intro deck, so those writes landed on
`videos/machine-learning/01_ml-intro/slides_progress.db` row 38 ("How Training Takes Place
to learn the model ?").

Full detail: **`qa/slide038/INCIDENT_stray_db_write.md`**. Summary:
- Damage was confined to 5 fields of one row: `gen_status` `passed`→`building`,
  `pptx_path`/`build_script` repointed into THIS deck, `visual_attempts` 1→0,
  `last_error` NULL→`''` (plus `updated_at`). A row-by-row diff of all 64 rows proved no
  other row and no other table changed; `visual_check=PASS` and `visual_transcript` were
  untouched.
- **Repaired by value, not by file**: I restored those 5 fields to the `git show HEAD:`
  values and re-verified row 38 field-for-field identical to HEAD. The corrupted file is
  backed up at `scratch/tmp/slide038/ml-intro-CORRUPTED-BY-W4-STRAY-SET.db.bak`.
- Restoring the HEAD file byte-for-byte would have been **wrong and destructive**: the live
  ml-intro DB carries 4 columns absent from HEAD (`pattern_group`, `pattern_seq`,
  `worker_id`, `worker_heartbeat_at`) because its schema was migrated after that commit.
  A file-level restore would have dropped those columns for every worker in the fleet.
- The only remaining live-vs-HEAD diff anywhere in that file is row 35's `updated_at`
  (2026-10-19T15:27:34 vs HEAD 2026-10-10T06:03:55), which **predates this session and was
  not written by me** — left alone deliberately so I would not erase prior legitimate
  history.
- Process fix for the rest of the run: every subsequent `15_progress.py` invocation was
  written as a single statement with the `VIDEO=` prefix in it, and every write read back
  with a `get`.

**Reported here because the dispatch brief requires it.**

`build/slide_038.js` (unchanged geometry by me — the predecessor's fix was verified correct).

### Equations / OMML
The slide has **no equations** (title-only, three text lines), so there is no
`mathtext → 600dpi PNG → addImage` build, **no `eq_038_*.json` sidecars under
`build/assets/`**, and **no OMML wrap applies** (`scripts/18_omml_wrapper.py` is an
equation-slide pass). Nothing awaiting the orchestrator's post-certification pass.

### Web-source research leg
NOT performed by me — it is not part of this build dispatch (research is
interleaved-with-builds and never dependency-gates certification; the deck's economy law
says to check sibling SOURCES.md records before re-spending queries). Query budget spent on
research: **0**.

## 5. Final status

`gen_status='passed'`, `visual_check='PASS'` (both judge legs), `worker_report.md` banked,
claim released. **Slide 038 is CERTIFIED.**
