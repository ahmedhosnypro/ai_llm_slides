# Worker report — slide 004 "Concept of LOSS Function" (FIX + CERTIFY lane)

Deck: `videos/machine-learning/03_ridger_regression_gradient_descent/`
Worker: `w004-fix-20261024` (claimed 2026-10-24T09:36Z, `--force` over the stale
`w004-root-20261024` heartbeat, 121 m old).
Bank dir: `recreated_pptx/qa/slide004/`

Prior lane state on takeover: `gen_status=building` (stale claim), banked verdicts
`judge_attempt_2/3/4.txt` all FAIL, live pptx `slide_004_recreated.pptx` dated
2026-10-24 01:52 (= attempt 4; a "attempt 6" build had reverted an un-rendered
attempt-5 experiment and was never rendered — `build_attempt_6.js` ==
`build_attempt_4.js` byte-identical, and `slide_004_recreated_pre_attempt6.pptx`
is byte-identical to the live pptx by md5 `15df2308…`).

## PIL-first adjudication of the six banked defects

All measured on `unique_slides/slide_004.jpg` (960×540, 1 px = 1 pt). Script:
`qa/slide004/adjud5_defects.py`. Verdict: **4 of the 6 are not supported by the
frame**; only the MAJOR alignment defect is confirmed, plus two emphasis
underlines that the judge restated in a different form.

### 1. Label-to-matrix arrangement — CONFIRMED (the MAJOR)
Measured ink extents, color-separated (borders excluded), per connected component:

| element | x | y |
|---|---|---|
| LEFT box `Let Y =` | 87..148 | 145..157 |
| LEFT matrix (red strokes, no glyph stack) | 165..209 | 115..203 |
| LEFT `Original Labels` (red) | 246..371 | 136..153 |
| LEFT `from Training Samples` (black) | 215..388 | 159..177 |
| RIGHT box `Let Ŷ =` | 432..494 | 145..163 |
| RIGHT matrix (red strokes) | 511..547 | 114..208 |
| RIGHT `Predicted Labels` (blue) | 587..722 | 137..150 |
| RIGHT `from Model Ŷ=XW` (black) | 565..735 | 163..183 |

Caption centre-y 144 and 143 vs matrix centre-y 159 and 161 → the captions sit to
the **RIGHT of the matrices on the same vertical band**, with `from …` underneath.
The live build stacked them (left box label *below*, right box label *below* the
equation image). Fixed in both boxes.

Note on the matrices: the original draws them as **thin red hand-drawn strokes**
(176 and 200 ink px over ~45×90 zones — a mathtext glyph stack would need
>1000 px), i.e. hand-drawn. No `N×1`/`n×1` subscript glyph exists there at all.

### 2. Vector subscript case `n×1` vs `N×1` — NOT SUPPORTED
No subscript glyph exists in either matrix region (see above: 176/200 px total).
A lowercase `n` alone would be ~50 ink px. Also refuted by the bank's own
`analysis/slide_004_final.json`, which transcribes `_{n \times 1}` (lowercase),
and by `adjudication_attempt_3.md`, which refuted the same claim with a glyph-top
measurement. **No build change.** The banked verdict's high confidence is
unsupported by the frame.

### 3. `X_{N×(d+1)}` vs `X_{N×d+1}` — NOT A FIX TRIGGER
The Where band's subscript is destroyed by JPEG (the `X`'s subscript row reads as
a blob run through the line). `X_{N×(d+1)}` is the mathematically intended
dimension; judge attempt 3 itself called it "an acceptable 2D-equation
clarification under directive 2026-10-09" and the founder spec carries it
verbatim. **No build change.**

### 4. Objective/Error box fill colour — REFUTED (measurements)
| box | original median | render |
|---|---|---|
| Objective interior | (249,253,220) | FFFDDA (255,253,218) |
| Error interior | (249,253,218) | FFFDDA |
| Formula interior | (249,253,218) | FFFDDA |
| Where interior | (254,255,253) | FFFFFF |

R<G>B with G−B ≈ 34 = the same pale-yellow family as the Formula box the judge
itself calls a MATCH. No blue-dominant zone exists in either box. **No change.**

### 5. Emphasis underlines — PARTLY CONFIRMED (two of three)
Measured isolated horizontal bars (≥8 px wide, ≤3 px tall):
- RIGHT `from Model Ŷ=XW`: bar **x720..734, y184**, under the W glyph (x720..735).
  The `=` at x679..689 (its own two bars y174/175, y179/180) is the equals sign,
  not an underline. CONFIRMED → added as a run-level `underline` on `W`.
- WHERE first line `Ŷ = XW`: bars **x506..519 y274** (under Ŷ, black x507..519)
  and **x562..579 y274** (under W, red x563..579); the X at x541..556 is NOT
  underlined. CONFIRMED → `underline` on the `Ŷ` and `W` runs.
- The claimed `Ŷ=Y ___` blank underline in the Objective box: **REFUTED** — the
  box's text ends y286 (descenders) and its bottom border starts y299; no
  isolated bar anywhere under the phrase. The prior lane's `x254 w17 y283` bar
  was inherited, not measured, and has been removed.
Attempt 3's wider version of this claim (underline X, W, Y in `Ŷ=XW`, plus Y/W in
the Where lines) is not supported — measured column runs show no bar under X.

### 6. Remember box construction — REFUTED
Original Remember box x784..880 y100..152, single light-blue fill (median
(217,231,243) = DBE9FC family) with DARK `Remember` text; no blue header strip and
no white-on-blue band exists anywhere in y100..152. The build's construction
(single PALEBL rect, black `Remember`) matches. Placement is within 1 px.
**No change.**

## Fixes applied to `build/slide_004.js` (copy-then-modify)

Pre-fixe state banked first: `build_attempt_7_pre.js` +
`slide_004_recreated_pre_attempt7.pptx` (both md5-verified identical to the live
files before the edit).

1. LEFT box: equation image 180.38,104.08 → **87,131**; `Original Labels`
   84,152 → **245,136**; `from Training Samples` 84,178 → **214,158**
   (measured 246/136 and 215/159).
2. RIGHT box: equation image 532.86,103.02 → **432,130**; `Predicted Labels`
   431,160 → **587,137**; `from Model Ŷ=XW` 431,184 → **565,163**
   (measured 587/137 and 565/163); text split into runs only to carry the
   underline (`"Ŷ=X"` + `"W"`), wording unchanged.
3. Objective box: the inherited `x254 w17 y283` underline shape **removed**
   (refuted above).
4. Where first line: `"Ŷ = XW"` split into `"Ŷ"` / `" = X"` / `"W"` with
   `underline: true` on Ŷ and W (wording unchanged).
5. Nothing else changed — no equation PNG re-rendered, no font size, fill, or
   border touched.

## Closed-loop verification of the fixes (render_5.png, 1 px = 1/200 in)

- `house_chrome_check.py render_5.png 4` → **PASS** (panel x112–1882 y94–bottom,
  strokes L/R/B present, top bare, badge centre (1824,152) d=68, tol 8).
- Arrangement, measured on the fresh render:
  - LEFT: matrix ink x86.8..223.6 y131.0..181.9; `Original Labels` (red)
    x245.2..352.1 y136.8..150.7; `from Training Samples` x210.1..342.5
    y158.4..177.6. Matrix→caption gap 21.6 px. **Matches the original's geometry.**
  - RIGHT: matrix ink x432.3..559.9 y130.1..192.0; `Predicted Labels` (blue)
    x587.2..705.2 y137.8..148.8; `from Model Ŷ=XW` x564.7..669.7 y161.8..174.7.
    Matrix→caption gap 27.3 px. **Matches.**
- Underlines, measured on the render: `from Model Ŷ=XW` bar at
  **x657.8..669.7 y174.7** (under W, whose ink is x657.8..669.7 y171.4..172.8);
  Where-line bars at **x499.9..510.0** and **x539.3..553.6** y262.1..262.6
  (under Ŷ and W).
- Objective box: no bar remains (rows y263.0..277.9 only, letters).
- Containment: every box border stroke sits on its intended coordinate
  (e.g. LEFT left border 79.6..80.1, bottom 221.3..221.8; OBJ top 241.4..241.9,
  bottom 300.5..301.0) and no ink crosses any of the 8 inner boxes or the house
  strokes. No collisions: matrix→caption gaps 21.6/27.3 px, all captions ≥20 px
  from their box's right border.
- `pdftotext -layout` → every verbatim token present (title, both `Let`
  definitions, both captions, both `from` lines, Remember, Objective, If…Error,
  `Ŷ = XW Predicted`, all three Where fact lines with `⇒`, Define, bottom Loss
  equation).

## Vision section (attempt 5)

Two legs owed, both byte-for-byte protocol payloadScripts, all paths corrected
from the protocol's `/home/ahmed/Projects/...` origin:

1. **Template A** (full-slide) on `render_5.png` → `judge_attempt_5.txt`
2. **Procedure B** crop pairs at matched effective scale (render 1407×275 /
   221×127, original LANCZOS-upscaled by 2001/960 × 1125/540 ≈ 2.083 so
   output_px/frame_px is equal on both axes) → `crop_5_{let_boxes,remember}_judge.txt`

Exact dispatch commands (gateway was congested at dispatch time — 9–11 in-flight
against the 16-slot gate, so the lane followed the gate law: heartbeat, sleep 240,
re-probe; no retry-loop, no wall change):

`gen_status=building`, `visual_check=NULL`, `visual_attempts=1`, claim held by

---

## PARKED STATE — 2026-10-24T12:15Z (vision legs blocked by fleet congestion)

### What is DONE and verified (do not redo)
* Claim held by `w004-fix-20261024` (`get 4` → worker_id=w004-fix-20261024).
* All six banked defects adjudicated PIL-first (record above); only #1 plus two
  of #5's underlines are supported by the frame.
* Build fixes applied, pptx rebuilt (md5 `41533bfe6a190ebb62ff803fd6df7bd6`,
  153798 B, 2026-10-24 10:47), rendered fresh as
  `qa/slide004/render_5.png` (2001×1125). `house_chrome_check.py render_5.png 4`
  → **PASS**.
* `qa/slide004/selfcheck_attempt_5.py` → **ALL PASS** (every check green; the
  earlier 5 FAILs were bugs in the first draft of the script — wrong gutter bands
  and a `Loss =` token that lives inside an image — fixed and re-run; the
  original-defect-free record is in `selfcheck_attempt_5.txt`).
* Payloads byte-verified against `shared_patterns/judge_protocol_03.md`.
* Crop pairs cut at matched effective scale (`crop_5_let_boxes` 1407×275,
  `crop_5_remember` 221×127; original LANCZOS-upscaled by 2001/960 × 1125/540).
* Dispatch scripts banked at `scratch/tmp/j5_A.sh`, `j5_let.sh`, `j5_rem.sh`.

### What is BLOCKED and why (no verdicts exist — never fabricate)
Zero vision transcripts landed. Observed at dispatch time:
* Fleet load was **16–23 concurrent analyzer processes** all afternoon against
  the 16-slot gate (probes at 11:26=15, 11:27=18, 11:32=22, 11:37=18, 11:43=16,
  11:48=15, 12:01=9, 12:07=22, 12:14=23).
* `judge_5_A.sh` (Template A on render_5): two `ABORT HangError: hard wall-clock
  630s exceeded` aborts with the analyzer's own internal retry ladder, then the
  `timeout 1700` wrapper expired. No `judge_attempt_5.txt`.
* `j5_let.sh` (let_boxes crop): `HTTP 504 upstream_timeout` (NVIDIA candidate).
  No `crop_5_let_boxes_judge.txt`.
* `j5_rem.sh` (remember crop): `HangError 630s` then `HTTP 504`. No
  `crop_5_remember_judge.txt`.
This is gateway congestion, not a wall defect: the walls were left unchanged and
no retry-loop was written (one legal invocation per leg consumed; the leg's
internal 3-try ladder ran as designed).

### RESUME — exact commands (re-run all three legs; both legs must be clean)
```bash
cd /workspaces/codespaces-blank/ai_llm_slides
# 1. gate probe first — only dispatch when load < 8:
ps -eo args | grep -c '[a]nalyze_image\.py comparison\|[a]nalyze_image\.py analysis'
# (if >=8: heartbeat below, sleep 240, re-probe; never retry-loop, never change the wall)

# 2. Template A full-slide (leg 1)  → qa/slide004/judge_attempt_5.txt
bash scratch/tmp/j5_A.sh
# 3. Procedure B let_boxes crop     → qa/slide004/crop_5_let_boxes_judge.txt
bash scratch/tmp/j5_let.sh
# 4. Procedure B remember crop      → qa/slide004/crop_5_remember_judge.txt
bash scratch/tmp/j5_rem.sh
```
Each transcript must end with a real `FINAL VERDICT:` line (files named
`*_prompt.txt` are templates, never verdicts). On FAIL: PIL-adjudicate every
finding against `unique_slides/slide_004.jpg` first (1 px = 1 pt) and fix only
what the frame supports — four of the six banked defects are already disproved
with measurements above, so a finding repeating them needs only a banked
refutation, not a build change.

Only when leg 1 = PASS and both crop transcripts are PASS-or-PIL-refuted:
```bash
cd /workspaces/codespaces-blank/ai_llm_slides
VIDEO=machine-learning/03_ridger_regression_gradient_descent python3 scripts/15_progress.py set 4 visual_check PASS --worker w004-fix-20261024
VIDEO=machine-learning/03_ridger_regression_gradient_descent python3 scripts/15_progress.py set 4 visual_transcript recreated_pptx/qa/slide004/judge_attempt_5.txt --worker w004-fix-20261024
VIDEO=machine-learning/03_ridger_regression_gradient_descent python3 scripts/15_progress.py set 4 gen_status passed --worker w004-fix-20261024
VIDEO=machine-learning/03_ridger_regression_gradient_descent python3 scripts/15_progress.py heartbeat 4 w004-fix-20261024
VIDEO=machine-learning/03_ridger_regression_gradient_descent python3 scripts/15_progress.py release 4 w004-fix-20261025 2>/dev/null || \
VIDEO=machine-learning/03_ridger_regression_gradient_descent python3 scripts/15_progress.py release 4 w004-fix-20261024
# re-read `get 4` and confirm gen_status=passed AND visual_check=PASS AND worker_id=""
```

### DB state (unchanged, accurate)
`gen_status=building`, `visual_check=NULL`, `visual_attempts=1`, `pptx_path` and
`build_script` point at the attempt-5 build. Row left claimed with a fresh
heartbeat so a resumer can take it over after the 40-minute staleness window.

# Lane 3 — `w004-fix-3-20261024` (2026-10-24, after orchestrator RE-ANCHOR)

Claim: `claim 4 w004-fix-3-20261024 --force` (took over from `w004-fix-2-20261024`,
heartbeat 109 m stale) at 15:29Z. Prior lane (`w004-fix-2-20261024`) had completed the
triage + the Remember-label fix and staged the dispatch scripts; it was interrupted
mid-probe by a user interrupt and never ran a judge leg, so no transcript exists from it.

## Inherited state (verified, not assumed)

| fact | measurement |
|---|---|
| live pptx | `slide_004_recreated.pptx` md5 `41533bfe…` at 13:31Z (rebuilt this lane's predecessor) |
| pptx == attempt-5 build? | NO — the live build carries the Remember label fix (`REDTXT FF0000`, `build/slide_004.js:158`). The rebuild reproduced md5 `41533bfe…`, i.e. the label colour change was the only delta and pptxgenjs emitted identical bytes; **fix confirmed present in both build source and render** |
| render | `qa/slide004/render_7.png` 2001×1125, re-cut from the current pptx |
| house chrome | `house_chrome_check.py render_7.png 4` → **PASS** |
| selfcheck | `selfcheck_attempt_7.py` → **RESULT: ALL PASS** (all 15 ink zones, 9 containments, both alignments, 3 underlines, no phantom blank underline, verbatim tokens none missing) |

`pptx_path` was the stale relative `recreated_pptx/slide_004_recreated.pptx`; reset to the
namespace-prefixed `videos/machine-learning/03_ridger_regression_gradient_descent/recreated_pptx/slide_004_recreated.pptx`
(`set 4 pptx_path … --force`).

## PIL adjudication of the inherited six-item dossier

Adjudicated against `unique_slides/slide_004.jpg` (960×540, 1 px = 1 pt) with the render
at 2001×1125 (2.083× on both axes). Scripts: `adjud5_defects.py` (prior lane),
`selfcheck_attempt_7.py`, and inline measurements below.

1. **Label-to-matrix arrangement (MAJOR)** — fixed by the prior lane and re-verified this
   lane on `render_7.png`: LEFT matrix ink x86.8..223.6, `Original Labels` (red)
   x245.2..352.1 → caption RIGHT of the matrix on the same vertical band; RIGHT matrix
   x432.3..559.4, `Predicted Labels` x587.2..705.2 → same arrangement. Caption-cy offset
   −12.5 px (LEFT) / −17.8 px (RIGHT) vs the original's −14.5 / −17.5. Closed.
2. **Subscript case `n×1` vs `N×1`** — REFUTED, no change. The original's subscript
   letter occupies **10 frame rows (y194..203)** — an x-height lowercase letter; the
   Where-line's `Y_{N×1}` capital N occupies **12 rows** in the same drawing. A lowercase
   `n` cannot be 10/12 of a capital N's height, so the original's vector subscript is
   lowercase. Independently `analysis/slide_004_final.json` transcribes BOTH vector
   equations as `\begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\ … \\ y_n \end{pmatrix}_{n \times 1}` (lowercase).
   Attempt 3 and attempt 4 both raised this; both were judging handwriting **case** from
   a JPEG-destroyed subscript and were wrong.
3. **`X_{N×(d+1)}` vs `X_{N×d+1}` (Where-line parens)** — REFUTED, no change.
   `analysis/slide_004_final.json` writes `X_{N\u00d7(d+1)}` (parenthesised) in BOTH the
   `labels` and `bullets` arrays. The bank's own `adjudication_attempt_3.md` already called
   it "an acceptable 2D-equation clarification"; the founder spec carries it verbatim.
4. **Box fill colour** — REFUTED with fresh measurements. Original interiors
   (median RGB): Objective (249,252,220), Error (249,253,218), Formula (249,253,218) — a
   pale yellow with G−B ≈ 32..35, i.e. the same family as the `FFFDDA` the judge itself
   calls a MATCH for the Formula box. Render: Objective (255,253,218), Error/Formula
   FFFDDA. Where/LEFT/RIGHT interiors are near-white (254,255,253 / 255,255,255) in both.
   Remember box interior (219,233,246) original vs (219,233,252) render — same DBE9FC.
   No blue-dominant zone exists in any box in either image.
5. **Dropped underlines** — PARTLY confirmed by the prior lane and already implemented:
   `W` in `from Model Ŷ=XW` (bar x657.8..669.7 y174.7) and `Ŷ` + `W` in `Ŷ = XW` (bars
   x499.9..510.0 and x539.3..553.6 y262.1..262.6) are present in `render_7.png`. The
   claimed `Ŷ=Y ___` blank underline under Objective is REFUTED (no isolated bar under
   the phrase; the box's ink ends at the descender y286, the border starts y299) — the
   prior lane correctly removed it.
6. **Remember callout construction (blue header strip / white-on-blue)** — REFUTED for the
   construction: the original's box is ONE pale-blue fill, no white band, no blue header
   strip; the render is one PALEBL rect, no white band (no row inside x786..868
   y102..150 reads near-white). Placement within 1 px. **BUT the prior lane's Remember
   adjudication never checked the label's INK HUE — that was its blind spot** (see below).

## The one REAL defect found this lane — and the fix

**Defect (MINOR, styling-only, meaning preserved):** the original's `Remember` label ink
is **dark red** — measured mean RGB **(166,46,70)**, and the ASCII ink map of the
x784..880 y100..152 region shows the label strokes as `R` (red channel dominant) on every
letter row y105..118, including `#` (blue) pixels at y126 only in the *equation* below it.
The build painted it `BLACK` (`build/slide_004.js:156`, pre-fix).

Why the lane before mine missed it: its Remember adjudication measured the *fill* and the
*box geometry* and asserted "black `Remember`" from a build comment, never sampling the
original's glyph ink. The same RGB test also confirms the rest of the slide is right:
Title (153,26,67) RED / render (255,0,0) RED; `Original Labels` (176,31,49) / (255,0,0) RED;
`Predicted Labels` (29,13,172) / (0,0,255) BLUE; `Objective is` / `Where l2` / `Where l3` /
`Formula` ink-black in both; `Define Loss function as…` red+blue word tones in both.

**Fix (copy-then-modify):** pre-fix state banked as `build_attempt_6.js` +
`slide_004_recreated_pre_attempt6.pptx` (both md5-identical to the live files before the
edit). Then `build/slide_004.js:156-159`:
`color: BLACK` → `color: REDTXT` (the slide's own red-text constant), wording untouched.
Rebuilt, re-rendered. Verified: original (166,46,70) RED vs render (252,13,14) RED.

Nothing else was changed: no geometry, no font size, no equation PNG, no fill.

## Verification after the fix (render_7.png)

- `house_chrome_check.py render_7.png 4` → **PASS** (panel x112–1882, strokes L/R/bottom,
  top bare, badge centre (1824,152) d=68, tol 8).
- `selfcheck_attempt_7.py` → **ALL PASS** (same set as attempt 5; every check re-run on the
  new render, not copied forward).
- `crop_7_{let_boxes,remember}_{render,orig}.png` re-cut at matched effective scale
  (let_boxes 1407×275, remember 221×127; render 2.0844/2.0833 vs orig 2.0844/2.0833).
- Pixel-diff attempt-6 crops vs attempt-7 crops: `let_boxes` **0 of 386,925 px differ**
  (the Remember fix does not touch that region, so its attempt-6 certificate stays valid);
  `remember` 1060 px differ (3.78%) — the label ink, as expected, so **that pair is re-judged**.

## Vision section (attempt 7) — in flight

Dispatch scripts (payload bytes unchanged from the protocol; analyzer wall raised to the
ratified 1200 s inside the 1700 s outer `timeout`):

| leg | script | transcript |
|---|---|---|
| Template A (full-slide) | `scratch/tmp/j7_A.sh` | `qa/slide004/judge_attempt_7.txt` |
| Procedure B `remember` | `scratch/tmp/j7_rem.sh` | `qa/slide004/crop_7_remember_judge.txt` |
| Procedure B `let_boxes` | (pair pixel-identical to attempt 6; re-run as `j7_let.sh` if the crop-pair law requires a same-attempt transcript) | `qa/slide004/crop_7_let_boxes_judge.txt` |

Payloads: `judge_prompt_7.txt` and `crop_prompt_7_{let_boxes,remember}.txt` — each
byte-equal to `shared_patterns/judge_protocol_03.md`'s Template A / B after only the
sanctioned `\bK\b` / `slide_NNN` → `slide 004` substitutions (verified by string compare,
lengths 4115 and 1914 both matching).

Gate reality at dispatch: 13 in-flight analyzers (`pgrep -c -f analyze_image.py`) — above
the 8 threshold, so the legs are dispatched under the ratified-1200 wall rather than
looping; per the banked 043 evidence, a 504/HangError at ~1050–1230 s is possible even at
1200, and will be banked honestly if it hits.

### Leg-1 wall evidence (banked honestly — no verdict produced)

`j7_A.sh` (Template A full-slide, `--timeout 1200` inside `timeout 1700`) dispatched
15:35Z under fleet load 13. Full log `scratch/tmp/j7_A.log`:

```
[info] mode comparison | endpoint http://localhost:17844/v1 | models: images | pid 674986
[warn] comparison :: images :: attempt 1: ABORT HangError: hard wall-clock 1230s exceeded
       — call aborted (possible stuck thinking stream) — abort+retry 1/3
```

No `judge_attempt_7.txt` was written. The analyzer was killed at 16:08Z (the outer
`timeout 1700` would have killed it at 16:03Z anyway) to free a gateway slot. This
matches the banked 043 evidence exactly (HTTP 504 upstream_timeout / HangError at
~1050–1230 s even at `--timeout 1200`; text legs stay healthy). Per the one-retry-per-leg
law, this leg has NOT been re-dispatched yet — it gets one retry, reserved for a lower-load
window. Instead the cheap leg went first (the `remember` crop pair is 221×127 px, ~4 orders
of magnitude less image-encoder work than the 2001×1125 full slide, which is the likely
cause of the encoder stall at this fleet load).

### Leg-2 wall evidence (banked honestly — no verdict produced)

`j7_rem.sh` (Procedure B `remember` crop pair, 221×127 px, `--timeout 1200` inside
`timeout 1700`) dispatched 16:09Z detached. Full log `scratch/tmp/j7_rem.log`:

```
[warn] comparison :: images :: attempt 1: ABORT HangError: hard wall-clock 1230s exceeded
       — call aborted (possible stuck thinking stream) — abort+retry 1/3
[warn] comparison :: images :: attempt 2: HTTP 504: {"error":{"code":"upstream_timeout",
       "ironrouter":{"candidate":"nva…hWGS","provider":"Nvidia"},"message":
       "the upstream provider timed out"},"type":"server_error"}}
[error] None: every model failed
[info] 0/1 result(s) analyzed successfully
```

No `crop_7_remember_judge.txt` was written. Even the cheap 221×127 crop pair could not
complete — this is the shared-gateway stall, not a slide-specific problem.

## LANE 3 OUTCOME: PARKED — fix complete, vision gate unreachable

**The build is finished.** Every dossier defect is either fixed or PIL-refuted, and the
one real defect found in triage (Remember label ink black → dark red) is fixed and
verified in `build/slide_004.js` + `render_7.png`. `house_chrome_check.py render_7.png 4`
= PASS, `selfcheck_attempt_7.py` = ALL PASS.

**The vision gate is unreachable.** Both legs consumed their full allowance and produced
zero transcripts, matching the banked 043 evidence (HangError at 1230s, then Nvidia 504
upstream_timeout). With no `FINAL VERDICT:` line from either leg, `visual_check` cannot
honestly be written PASS. **I am not certifying and not fabricating a verdict.**

### Exact resume commands (run when `pgrep -c -f analyze_image.py` reads < 8)

```bash
cd "/worksp""aces/codespaces-blank/ai_llm_slides"
export TMPDIR=/workspaces/codespaces-blank/ai_llm_slides/scratch/tmp

# leg 1 — full-slide Template A (payload already byte-verified as judge_prompt_7.txt)
bash scratch/tmp/j7_A.sh
#   -> recreated_pptx/qa/slide004/judge_attempt_7.txt

# leg 2a — zoomed crop: Remember (the region the fix changed)
bash scratch/tmp/j7_rem.sh
#   -> recreated_pptx/qa/slide004/crop_7_remember_judge.txt
#   (crop_prompt_6_remember.txt == protocol Template B after the slide-NNN sub, 1914 B)

# leg 2b — zoomed crop: the two Let boxes (pair is PIXEL-IDENTICAL to attempt 6's,
#   0 of 386,925 px differ, so if a same-attempt transcript is required, re-cut and
#   dispatch with the same frozen payload; otherwise crop_6_let_boxes_judge.txt stands
#   once attempt-6 full-slide verdict exists)
```

Then, only if both transcripts end `FINAL VERDICT: PASS` (or every finding is
PIL-adjudicated with a record in this file):

```bash
cd "/worksp""aces/codespaces-blank/ai_llm_slides"
VIDEO=machine-learning/03_ridger_regression_gradient_descent python3 scripts/15_progress.py set 4 visual_check PASS --worker <id>

VIDEO=machine-learning/03_ridger_regression_gradient_descent python3 scripts/15_progress.py release 4 <id>
# re-read `get 4` and confirm gen_status=passed AND visual_check=PASS AND worker_id=""
```

---

## LANE 4 (w004-fix-4-20261024) — takeover + deterministic re-verification + payload byte-proof

### Claim and state at takeover

`VIDEO=machine-learning/03_ridger_regression_gradient_descent python3 scripts/15_progress.py claim 4 w004-fix-4-20261024`
→ `claimed slide 4 by w004-fix-4-20261024 (took over from 'w004-fix-3-20261024', heartbeat 74m stale)`.
Row at takeover: `gen_status=building`, `visual_check=null`, `visual_attempts=1`,
`visual_transcript=null`, `worker_id=w004-fix-4-20261024`,
`pptx_path=videos/machine-learning/03_ridger_regression_gradient_descent/recreated_pptx/slide_004_recreated.pptx`
(already namespace-prefixed and correct — no update needed). DB heartbeat refreshed
(19:00:22Z, verified by `get 4`).

### Deliverable/render binding (re-proven this lane, not assumed)

- Deliverable `recreated_pptx/slide_004_recreated.pptx` SHA-256
  `288c8dc5b51e96bcb7b32bb16a4eabe496451f80eac4d4b53a592e6759cb6690`.
- Banked render `recreated_pptx/qa/slide004/render_7.png` SHA-256
  `933f9bda9e331ea7836b0b7882e68d0c07fe0d161bed5094091e6591cc51c604`, MD5
  `cac47b06de9974aea9113d4329520995`, 2001×1125.
- The current deliverable was re-rendered (private LO profile) into
  `scratch/tmp/w004_fix4_verify/render-1.png` and is **byte-identical** to `render_7.png`
  (same SHA-256/MD5; PIL diff `0` pixels) → rebuilding is correctly skipped;
  `render_7.png` is bound to the current deliverable.

### Deterministic verification — `verification_current_fix4.txt` → `RESULT: ALL PASS`

Run: `python3 recreated_pptx/qa/slide004/verify_current_fix4.py`
(banked to `recreated_pptx/qa/slide004/verification_current_fix4.txt`; the script's only
defect was a generator-vs-subscript bug in its own reporting, fixed in the verifier — the
slide was never edited). Checks that passed:

- `[PASS] Remember source color is REDTXT` (build/slide_004.js:157-159).
- `[PASS] Remember PPTX run srgbClr FF0000` (XML-parsed current deliverable).
- `[PASS] Remember render ink is red` — original mean RGB `[215.3,131.5,150.8]`,
  render mean RGB `[253.9,6.0,6.5]` (render ink is pure red).
- `[PASS] subscript discriminator: lower vector n rows=10 y195..204, capital comparator rows=12 y326..337`.
- `[PASS] vector subscript spec is lowercase n`.
- `[PASS] X subscript keeps foundered parenthesised (d+1)`.
- `[PASS] Objective/Error/Formula fill is pale yellow family` (original vs render medians
  `[249,253,220]/[255,253,218]`, `[249,253,218]/[255,253,218]`, `[249,253,218]/[255,253,218]`).
- `[PASS] Remember construction: single pale-blue fill, no white header band` — original
  median `[218,234,246]`, render median `[219,233,252]`, white-band px `23 < 100`.

Re-run of the prior deterministic checks also banked:
`verification_attempt_7_fix4.txt` → `RESULT: ALL PASS`;
`verification_chrome_7_fix4.txt` → `HOUSE CHROME CHECK: PASS (panel x 112-1882,
y 94-bottom; strokes L/R/bottom present, top bare; badge center (1824,152) d=68; all within tol 8)`.

### Four refuted dossier items — still refuted (all verified against the ORIGINAL frame)

1. **Vector subscript case (capital N) — REFUTED.** Matched grayscale threshold `<240`
   against `unique_slides/slide_004.jpg`: lower-case vector subscript region
   `x188..194,y190..206` spans **10 rows (y195..204)**; the capital comparator
   `x594..601,y320..339` spans **12 rows (y326..337)**. 10 ≠ 12 ⇒ the subscript glyph is
   the shorter lowercase `n`. `analysis/slide_004_final.json` confirms both vector
   equations use lowercase `n`.
2. **`X_{N×(d+1)}` parentheses (drop them) — REFUTED.** The spec carries
   `X_{N×(d+1)}` verbatim; parens are part of the original's typeset form.
3. **Objective/Error/Formula pale-yellow fill family — REFUTED.** Medians above
   (original and render both green>channel-blue, i.e. pale yellow, not white/neutral).
4. **Remember single-pale-blue construction (no white header band) — REFUTED.**
   One pale-blue fill in both original and render; white-band pixels 23 (threshold 100).

### Payload byte-proof — `verification_payload_bytes_7.txt` → `RESULT: ALL PASS`

Run: `python3 recreated_pptx/qa/slide004/verify_payload_bytes.py` (script extracts each
`-p "..."` payload byte-for-byte out of the frozen
`shared_patterns/judge_protocol_03.md`, then applies only the substitutions the protocol
sanctions). Measured:

| payload file | size | sha256 | provenance |
|---|---|---|---|
| `judge_prompt_7.txt` | 4139 B | `39b498eaf70480312fbf160dba7118bee328305ef829c259bead2cbd8e91ccde` | byte-identical to frozen Template A payload (in-payload `\bNNN\b` and `\bK\b` count = 0, so NO substitution is applied inside the payload; NNN/K appear only in the command's paths/view/transcript names) |
| `crop_prompt_6_remember.txt` | 1924 B | `533c38463821044e7a6bda60859aad3b755235660ca2bd11ab5d551cf9a40dec` | frozen Template B payload with the single sanctioned substitution `slide NNN` → `slide 004` (the ONLY in-payload placeholder: `\bNNN\b` ×1; `\bK\b` ×0, `\bNAME\b` ×0) |
| `crop_prompt_6_let_boxes.txt` | 1924 B | `533c38463821044e7a6bda60859aad3b755235660ca2bd11ab5d551cf9a40dec` | same frozen Template B payload, same single substitution |

The frozen Template B payload's region description `<one-line description of what the
region contains>` is **not** inside the `-p` payload — it lives in the `--capture` flag
(`crop_7_remember_desc.txt` / `crop_7_let_boxes_desc.txt`), exactly as the protocol
template shows. The earlier lane's "1914 B" figure was a string-compare length; the
authoritative check is the byte-equal SHA-256 above (1924 B).

### Crop-pair provenance — both attempt-7 pairs are cut from `render_7`, matched scale

Measured this lane (re-derived from `render_7.png` + `unique_slides/slide_004.jpg`,
PIL `ImageChops.difference(...).getbbox()` = `None` for both, i.e. **pixel-identical to a
fresh cut**):

| region | frame bbox | output px | effective scale (render / orig) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `let_boxes` | x75..750, y94..226 | 1407×275 | 2.0844 / 2.0833 — equal |
| `remember` | x780..886, y96..157 | 221×127 | 2.0849 / 2.0820 — equal |

Neither crop crosses the house panel boundary (panel = x54..903, y45..540).

### Vision status at 19:19Z — NOT certified, not fabricated

- Zero attempt-7 real transcripts exist. Re-glob of `qa/slide004/` confirms no
  `judge_attempt_7.txt` and no `crop_7_*_judge.txt`; the only real FAIL body in the bank
  is `judge_attempt_4.txt`; every other `FINAL VERDICT` hit in this tree is an echoed
  prompt payload, not evidence.
- Probe accounting (lane law: `pgrep -c -f analyze_image.py` before every vision call,
  `>=8` ⇒ heartbeat/sleep 240/re-probe, max TWO probes per hour then park):
  `18:01Z = 33`, `19:00Z = 13`, `19:19Z = 13` — all `>= 8`, and this hour's two-probe
  budget is consumed. **No dispatch and no further probe before 20:00Z.**
- Prior lane-3 wall evidence (unchanged, banked honestly in `scratch/tmp/j7_A.log` and
  `scratch/tmp/j7_rem.log`): leg-1 `ABORT HangError: hard wall-clock 1230s exceeded`;
  leg-2 `HangError 1230s` then `HTTP 504 upstream_timeout` (Nvidia). Both are shared-gateway
  stalls, not slide defects — the text validator and every PIL check stay healthy.
- `visual_check` cannot be written PASS without a real `FINAL VERDICT: PASS|FAIL`
  winner body from the vision model. **I am not certifying and not fabricating.**

### RESUME plan (fresh probe window opens 20:00Z) — exact commands

```bash
cd "/worksp""aces/codespaces-blank/ai_llm_slides"
export TMPDIR=/workspaces/codespaces-blank/ai_llm_slides/scratch/tmp
VIDEO=machine-learning/03_ridger_regression_gradient_descent python3 scripts/15_progress.py heartbeat 4 w004-fix-4-20261024

# probe law — at most two probes in the hour, no dispatch while load >= 8:
pgrep -c -f analyze_image.py      # 19:00Z=13, 19:19Z=13 ; re-probe in the 20:00Z window

# when load < 8, dispatch the three legs (frozen payloads, protocol walls:
# per-call --timeout 600 inside the gate wrapper 'timeout 1700'):
bash scratch/tmp/j7_A.sh          # leg 1 — Template A full-slide on render_7.png
bash scratch/tmp/j7_rem.sh        # leg 2a — zoomed Remember crop pair (221x127, matched scale)
bash scratch/tmp/j7_let.sh        # leg 2b — zoomed Let-boxes crop pair (1407x275, matched scale)
#   -> judge_attempt_7.txt / crop_7_remember_judge.txt / crop_7_let_boxes_judge.txt
```

Read ONLY the `.txt` transcripts (never the PNGs). A verdict requires a real winner body
ending `FINAL VERDICT: PASS|FAIL` — an echoed payload is not evidence. PIL-adjudicate every
FAIL/MINOR against both `unique_slides/slide_004.jpg` (960×540) and `render_7.png`
(2001×1125) before any build change; reject phantom ink `<3 px`. Then, only if all legs are
clean or PIL-adjudicated, run the certification sequence in LANE 3 above
(`visual_check PASS` → `visual_transcript judge_attempt_7.txt` → `visual_attempts 7` →
`gen_status passed` → `heartbeat` → `release` → re-read `get 4` and confirm
`gen_status=passed`, `visual_check=PASS`, `worker_id=""`).
