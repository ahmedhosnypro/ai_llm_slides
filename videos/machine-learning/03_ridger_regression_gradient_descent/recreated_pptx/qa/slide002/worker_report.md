# Worker report — slide 002 (badge numeral = 2)

**Slide:** 002 — "Revision of Standard Linear Regression Model"
**Deck:** `videos/machine-learning/03_ridger_regression_gradient_descent/`
**Worker:** `w4-s002-20261020T1857` (claimed 2026-10-20T18:57, released 2026-10-20T20:17)
**RESUMED** from multiple dead predecessors (vision-upstream outage). Attempt numbering
verified to start at 1: no judge transcript existed on disk before this run
(`qa/slide002/` had no `*judge*.txt` / `*transcript*` file); DB `visual_attempts` was
reset 0 under the outage ruling.

## FINAL VERDICT: PASS — CERTIFIED

| DB field | value |
|---|---|
| `gen_status` | `passed` |
| `visual_check` | `PASS` |
| `visual_attempts` | 1 |
| `visual_transcript` | `videos/machine-learning/03_ridger_regression_gradient_descent/recreated_pptx/qa/slide002/judge_attempt_1.txt` |
| `pptx_path` | `videos/machine-learning/03_ridger_regression_gradient_descent/recreated_pptx/slide_002_recreated.pptx` |
| `build_script` | `videos/machine-learning/03_ridger_regression_gradient_descent/recreated_pptx/build/slide_002.js` |

## Deliverable

Single version per founder law: `recreated_pptx/slide_002_recreated.pptx`
(md5 793dee51969741560ea4e679b17efe27 for the build script; pptx built 2026-10-19 and
verified pixel-current against the banked render on 2026-10-20).

## Attempts used

**1 of 6** (both judge legs on attempt 1, both clean).

### Judge legs (all on `render_1.png`, banked and verified current)

| Leg | Template / region | Transcript | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| Full-slide | A | `qa/slide002/judge_attempt_1.txt` | **PASS** — "faithful, usable recreation" |
| Zoomed crop | B — `title` (densest region: two-line red bold title, frame x189..764 y191..322) | `qa/slide002/crop_1_title_judge.txt` | **PASS** — "faithful, usable recreation of this region" |
| Zoomed crop | B — `badgeplus` (badge numeral 2 + gray "+" small-text cluster, frame x747..908 y47..103) | `qa/slide002/crop_1_badgeplus_judge.txt` | **PASS** |

Judge dispatch was executed by the worker directly (no Agent/spawn tool available in this
environment — orchestrator-approved fallback per `scripts/17_worker_instructions.md` step 6).
All prompts sourced byte-for-byte from `shared_patterns/judge_protocol_03.md`:
`judge_payload_A.txt` (4115 chars) and `crop_payload_B.txt` (1914 chars), both verified
md5-identical to the frozen templates.

Probe sequence (gateway window): three probes — 19:12 and 19:31 hung with no transcript
(upstream outage; do not consume budget), 19:37 produced a valid body
(`probe_1_w4c.txt`, 3436 bytes) and opened the window. Peers `slide022` (19:27) and
`slide038` (19:28) produced valid probe bodies the same evening — the upstream was
recovering, which matched what I observed.

### Judge-flag summary (one line)

Full-slide judge: **zero discrepancies**. Title crop: **zero discrepancies**. Badgeplus crop:
**five MINOR findings — all PIL-refuted** (plus-sign "larger/heavier" and the "thicker purple
ring" claims are inverted by measurement; the badge's mild 34x31 ellipse vs the law-mandated
circle and the numeral's 0.7px offset are chrome/calibration noise; the plus's lighter gray in
the original is a ground-ruled JPEG wash on a 2px hairline, the render using the spec's verbatim
`#808080`).

Full record: `qa/slide002/adjudication_badgeplus_1.txt`.

## Pre-judge verification (PIL, all PASS)

- `house_chrome_check.py render_1.png 002` → **PASS** (strokes L/R/bottom present, top bare,
  badge center within tol 8). Independent check: 0 red px in the top band y0..45 → no top stroke.
- 8-item self-check (`selfcheck_attempt_1.py`) → **PASS** (containment, bands=2, pitch 74.52 vs
  target 75.0, colors, numeral ink 254 px, wrap, census).
- Title line deltas vs the original frame: worst **1.36 frame px** (claim ≤1.4 verified).
  L1 max 0.68; L2 max 1.36.
- Banked render verified current: fresh render of the pptx → **0 of 2,251,125 px differ**.
- Crop pairs re-cut and md5-verified; effective scale matched per axis for both regions.
- Resume verification of every banked claim: `qa/slide002/RESUME_VERIFICATION.txt`.

## Notes for the orchestrator

- **No equations, no tables, no delimiters, no advanced graphs** on this slide (asserted per the
  spec and a PIL full-frame census) → **no `eq_*.json` sidecars banked** and the post-certification
  OMML wrap pass (`scripts/18_omml_wrapper.py`) is a **no-op for 002**. Banked build has zero
  images, so nothing to wrap.
- **DEPS: root** — no dependencies; build unblocked. **No dependents** in the deck's graph
  (`10>9`, `13>12`, `17>13`, `18>17` only) and this slide is a leaf on the pattern graph, so no
  component export obligation was triggered. `build/components/` was not written for 002.
- **Spec deviations documented** (frame + deck law win; recorded in the build script header):
  the spec's `#F2F2F2` background / `#FFFF00` badge / `[?]` border color are pre-house analysis
  values overridden by deck house chrome; the spec's guessed "66pt" title is replaced by the
  measured fit of 42.5pt; the 1px tan halo row at y46 across the panel top is a video/JPEG edge
  artifact present on all deck frames (including reference slide_003), not chrome law — not drawn.
- Evidence preserved, nothing deleted (`render_pre1.png`, `render_pre2.png`, `build_pre_tune1.js`,
  and the dead predecessors' measurement scripts all remain in `qa/slide002/`).
- Scratch used: `/home/ahmed/Projects/ai_llm_slides/scratch/tmp` (TMPDIR redirect per deck law);
  LibreOffice private profile `scratch/lo_slide002_render`.
