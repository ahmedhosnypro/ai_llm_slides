# Worker report — slide 005 (deck 03_ridger_regression_gradient_descent)

Worker: `w005-buildfirst-20261024` (took over from the retired `slide005-worker-1792792740`,
whose claim was 186 min stale)
Slide: 005 "Minimization of Loss function to obtain BEST model parameters"
Date: 2026-10-24. Deliverable: `recreated_pptx/slide_005_recreated.pptx` (single plain-named pptx)

## Status at hand-off

- **Build: CURRENT and fully verified** — pptx md5 `58de0cb2c39c5ef004e60d9f000a48a9`
  matches a deterministic rebuild of `build/slide_005.js` in every zip entry
  (only `docProps/core.xml`'s `dcterms:created` timestamp differs).
- **Render: CURRENT** — `qa/slide005/render_9.png`, 2001x1125 @150dpi
  (md5 `01bcb967f29e502e99e80925aa320599`), reproduced by soffice→PDF→`pdftoppm -r 150`.
- **House chrome: PASS** on render_9 (`shared_patterns/house_chrome_check.py … 5`,
  panel x112-1882 y94-bottom, L/R/bottom strokes present, top bare, badge (1824,152) d=68).
- **PIL self-check: PASS** — `selfcheck_attempt_8.txt` (runbook checks 1/2/3/4/8).
- **Judging: NOT DONE — PARKED on gateway congestion.** No verdict exists; no transcript
  containing `FINAL VERDICT:` has been banked by any lane.
- **DB row: left untouched** (`gen_status=building`, `visual_check=null`,
  `visual_attempts=0`, `visual_transcript=null`) — nothing was written except heartbeats.

## Lane history (attempts 1→9)

| render | states | notes |
|---|---|---|
| render_1..6 (retired worker) | chrome PASS, ~1px bands | eqFit + DejaVu font calibration; see that worker's report, banked as `qa/slide005/worker_report.md` |
| render_6 | judge render, never judged | gateway wall: 20-22 queued calls, zero transcripts fleet-wide |
| render_7 | reproduction check | rebuilt attempt 6's pptx, byte-identical to `render_6.png` (md5 `6a2d79…`) — proved the banked render was still current |
| render_8 | BAD EQ5 BAND | eq5 band wrongly stretched to x683 from a noise-inflated window measurement |
| render_9 | **CURRENT** | eq5 band reverted to attempt 6's value; getbest containment fix applied |

## Attempt-9 audit (what I measured on BOTH images before touching the build)

Law honoured: "measure everything against BOTH images before any build change".

1. **Build currency** — rebuilt the pptx from the live script; 21/22 zip entries byte-identical,
   only the `core.xml` timestamp differs. So `render_6.png` was still the current render.
2. **Render reproducibility** — fresh soffice render == `render_6.png` pixel-for-pixel.
3. **Font identification (exhaustive)** — probed all 1935 installed faces against the
   original's (advance, ink-height) pair for the title and the body line. **No installed
   font reproduces the original's metrics.** The original's authoring font is absent from
   this machine, so DejaVu Sans 18 pt (which matches the original's horizontal advance to
   1 px) is the best available: its vertical ink extent is 3-5 px shorter than the
   original's for every text element. That gap is an unavoidable font-substitution
   artifact, not a build error, and it is identical at any size that preserves the advance.
4. **My own scale bug, caught and corrected** — first selfcheck used `2001/540 = 3.71`
   as the render scale (mixing axes). Correct scales are `sx = 2001/960 = 2.084375`,
   `sy = 1125/540 = 2.083333`. Every "BLOCKER" that first run reported was an artifact
   of the wrong scale.
5. **Window contamination, caught and corrected** — several measurement windows touched
   enclosing-box border strokes (the pink box's right border at x505-506, the blue box's
   top border at y134-135, the green box's border), inflating ink extents on BOTH images.
   Final windows are strictly interior.

### Real defect found and fixed — "Get Best W that minimizes the loss" overflowed its box

Measured on BOTH images (window clear of the pink box's right border, and the border
subtracted via a row-band baseline):

- ORIGINAL text ink: x196..500, y306..322 — it **ends 5 px inside** the pink box's right
  border (x505..506), confirmed column-by-column (ink rows 5 px at x500, then 0 from x501).
- Attempt-6 RENDER text ink: x196.7..510.5 — 18 pt DejaVu Sans advances 316.3 px / inks
  314.5 px (PIL-verified), carrying the ink **4 px past the border at x506**. Per runbook
  check (5) that is a frame-containment MAJOR.

Fix (`build/slide_005.js`): size 18 → 17.4 pt (ink 304.3 px, ending x501, 4 px inside the
border) and the box nudged y303 → y306 so the line's centre sits on the original's ink
centre (314.0 frame px). Verified after re-render: REND ink x196.7..499.9, dx1 = -0.09 px.

### Real defect caught and REFUTED — eq5's arrow chain

An attempt-8 change stretched eq5's band from x637 to x683 on the strength of a window
measurement. Noise-rejected segmentation (a column needs ≥3 ink rows) refuted it:

- ORIGINAL: 26 real glyph groups, x97..x637. Its columns x639..x646 hold **ZERO** ink,
  x647..x683 hold only 1 px/col of JPEG noise, and x689+ is the green box's border.
- Attempt-6 RENDER: 27 real groups, x95..x638 — **it already matched the original.**
- Stretching to x683 added 3 glyph groups / ~45 px of arrow the original does not have.

Band reverted, re-rendered, and the two renders diffed: **10,480 px differ and every one of
them sits in the getbest band (frame x196.7..510.5, y303.4..319.7), 0 px outside it** —
proving the revert restored attempt 6's geometry everywhere else and that getbest is the
single surgical change.

## Final measured state (render_9 vs slide_005.jpg, frame px)

Worst per-element ink-band deviation = **3.64 px** (fleet TOL 8). Equations eq1..eq5,
pinkfrac, rem1, rem2, green, title, rememberU/L and getbest all within TOL on all four edges.
House-frame overflow: **0 px** on all four sides. Per-box containment: every element's ink
inside its measured border, including the previously-overflowing pink box. Fraction bars
present in all six stacked fractions. Explicit `lineSpacing` on every textbox (17.4/18/14/12).

## Judge status — PARKED (gateway wedged)

- Gateway state at hand-off: **13 queued `analyze_image.py` processes**, IronRouter on
  :17844 at **0.7-0.8 % CPU over 3h45m** (pid 3035) — accepting but never completing.
  A slide019 judge call has been queued 11+ min with no output. Fleet-wide transcript
  writes are zero.
- Per the standing gate law (`pgrep -c -f analyze_image.py` ≥ 8 ⇒ do NOT dispatch) I did
  not dispatch a single vision call. Dispatching into this congestion would waste ~25 min
  and return no verdict.
- **5 legs are cut, payloaded and ready to fire the instant the gate opens** — see below.
- A background watcher (`scratch/tmp/gatewatch_005.sh`) polls every 240 s and logs to
  `scratch/tmp/gatewatch_005.log`; it exits 0 and writes `GATE OPEN …` when the queue
  drops below 8.

## Ready-to-fire legs (all self-block on congestion; syntax-checked, none executed)

Commands run from the project root. Each checks the queue first and exits 3 without
dispatching if ≥8 `analyze_image.py` are queued.

1. `qa/slide005/dispatch_attempt9/leg_A_full_slide.sh` — Template A full-slide judge
   (render_9 vs slide_005.jpg) → `qa/slide005/judge_attempt_9.txt`.
2. `qa/slide005/dispatch_attempt9/leg_B_eq_stack.sh` → `crop_9_eq_stack_judge.txt`
3. `qa/slide005/dispatch_attempt9/leg_B_blue_upper.sh` → `crop_9_blue_upper_judge.txt`
4. `qa/slide005/dispatch_attempt9/leg_B_pink_band.sh` → `crop_9_pink_band_judge.txt`
5. `qa/slide005/dispatch_attempt9/leg_B_lower_eqs.sh` → `crop_9_lower_eqs_judge.txt`

Fire Template A first, then the crop pairs, one at a time (dot 6 of Procedure B: map every
finding back to slide space — crop-relative coords × crop scale = frame px).

### Crop pairs (Procedure B, matched effective scale)

Region = slide-space frame px with ~8 px padding; the original crop is LANCZOS-upscaled so
`output_px/frame_px` is EQUAL per axis (render is 2001x1125 @150dpi).

| leg | region (frame px) | output px | files |
|---|---|---|---|
| eq_stack | x88..650 y100..285 | 1172x386 | `crop_9_eq_stack_{render,orig}.png` |
| blue_upper | x660..890 y128..245 | 479x243 | `crop_9_blue_upper_{render,orig}.png` |
| pink_band | x65..515 y280..350 | 938x146 | `crop_9_pink_band_{render,orig}.png` |
| lower_eqs | x64..900 y350..530 | 1743x375 | `crop_9_lower_eqs_{render,orig}.png` |

Note for the pink_band leg: it is the only crop whose region contains the attempt-9 fix,
so it MUST be judged against render_9 (it is).

### Payloads (byte-for-byte from `shared_patterns/judge_protocol_03.md`)

- `qa/slide005/judge_prompt_9.txt` — Template A, 4115 B, `slide NNN`→`slide 005`,
  `\bK\b`→9. Round-trip verified against the protocol text; `BLOCKER` ×4 intact; exactly
  one `FINAL VERDICT:` line.
- `qa/slide005/crop_prompt_9_{eq_stack,blue_upper,pink_band,lower_eqs}.txt` — Template B,
  1914 B each (identical bytes), `slide NNN`→`slide 005`. Round-trip verified.

## Banked evidence

- **Current deliverable**: `recreated_pptx/slide_005_recreated.pptx` (`58de0cb2…`) +
  `recreated_pptx/build/slide_005.js` (`6a65b1f6…`).
- **Current render**: `qa/slide005/render_9.png` (`01bcb967…`).
- **Pre-change snapshots (never deleted)**: `qa/slide005/build_attempt_6.js`,
  `slide_005_attempt6.pptx`, `render_6.png`, `render_7_attempt6b.png`, `render_8.png`
  (the bad-eq5-band render, kept as the refutation record).
- **Measurements**: `qa/slide005/measure_attempt9/` (17 scripts: selfcheck, render,
  pptx compare, font probe, segmentation, band/containment audits, diff, gatewatch).
  Text outputs: `selfcheck_attempt_8.txt`, `house_chrome_3.txt`.
- **Judge kit**: `qa/slide005/judge_prompt_9.txt`, `crop_prompt_9_*.txt`,
  `crop_9_*_desc.txt`, `dispatch_attempt9/*.sh`.

## Certification sequence (runbook-prescribed; NOT yet performed)

Per `scripts/17_worker_instructions.md:329` — only after Template A ends `FINAL VERDICT: PASS`
AND every crop leg is clean or PIL-adjudicated:

```
VIDEO=machine-learning/03_ridger_regression_gradient_descent python3 scripts/15_progress.py set 5 visual_check PASS --worker w005-buildfirst-20261024
VIDEO=machine-learning/03_ridger_regression_gradient_descent python3 scripts/15_progress.py set 5 visual_transcript <full-slide transcript path> --worker w005-buildfirst-20261024
VIDEO=machine-learning/03_ridger_regression_gradient_descent python3 scripts/15_progress.py set 5 gen_status passed --worker w005-buildfirst-20261024
VIDEO=machine-learning/03_ridger_regression_gradient_descent python3 scripts/15_progress.py heartbeat 5 w005-buildfirst-20261024
VIDEO=machine-learning/03_ridger_regression_gradient_descent python3 scripts/15_progress.py release 5 w005-buildfirst-20261024
```

Then verify `get 5` shows `gen_status=passed`, `visual_check=PASS`, `worker_id=""`.
(There is no `record-visual` subcommand.) Only transcripts with a real `FINAL VERDICT:`
line count as verdicts — template lines inside the banked `*_prompt.txt` files do not.

```

## Query budget

No web searches were spent by this lane (the deck's web-source research leg for slide 005
is already `CONFIRMED` in `SOURCES_MAP.md`, so the economy law's "check sibling records
first" rule applied and no query was needed).

---

# Lane section — `w005-fresh-20261024` (2026-10-24 15:53 → 17:15)

## Claim / timeout-recovery history

- Took the lane over from `w005-buildfirst-20261024` via `claim` at 15:53 (the prior claim's
  `worker_heartbeat_at` was `2026-10-24T10:16:43` — **337 min stale**, the DB's zombie
  takeover path fired automatically; `--force` was not needed).
- Heartbeats at 15:53, 16:11, 16:35 (and in-session while waiting on the gate).

## Verdicts banked vs newly run by THIS lane

- **Newly run (vision): NONE.** Zero judge transcripts produced — see the park state below.
- **Banked by prior lanes and re-verified by me (all PIL/local, no vision):** render
  currency, house-chrome PASS, payload byte-fidelity, crop-pair scale-match, build
  determinism, ink-band deltas. Details below.
- The only transcript-less banked artifacts I re-confirmed are the evidence files
  (`render_9.png`, `slide_005_recreated.pptx`, `build/slide_005.js`), all current.

## Two REAL defects found in the STAGED DISPATCH KIT (repaired, payloads untouched)

The kit a prior lane left behind was **not runnable**. Both defects were in the shell
wrappers — never in the `-p` payloads:

1. **Broken path prefix in all 5 leg scripts.** Every `Q=`/`R=` line read
   `"/worksp/aces/codespaces-blank/..."` — a dead path (`ls /worksp` → "No such file or
   directory"). Had any leg fired, `cd "$R"` would have failed and `cat $Q/*.txt` would
   have come back empty, silently dispatching a judge with **no payload**. Repaired to the
   expand correctly on all 5 (`bash -c 'eval "$(sed -n "5,6p" leg_*.sh)"; echo $Q'` →
   `/workspaces/codespaces-blank/ai_llm_slides/videos/machine-learning/03_ridger_regression_gradient_descent/recreated_pptx/qa/slide005`, `R=/workspaces/codespaces-blank/ai_llm_slides`).
   Payload lines (`-p "$(cat $Q/...)"`) are byte-for-byte untouched.
2. **Wall mismatch vs the orchestrator's CRITICAL WALL OVERRIDE.** All 5 scripts carried the
   protocol-prescribed `--timeout 600`, but the override (superseding law) mandates
   `--timeout 1200` inside `timeout 1700`. Changed on all 5; the outer `timeout 1700` and
   every other wall are unchanged and no value exceeds 1200/1700.

## Verification performed (all reproduced independently, no vision calls)

| check | method | result |
|---|---|---|
| payload byte-fidelity | new `dispatch_attempt9/verify_payloads.py` — round-trips all 5 `-p` payloads against `shared_patterns/judge_protocol_03.md` Templates A/B with the substitutions applied | **PASS** — A 4115 B, B 1914 B ×4, all exact |
| late-landing transcripts | re-glob for the 5 attempt-9 transcript names + `find -newermt` | **none** — all 5 ABSENT, nothing redispatched |
| render currency | fresh `soffice --convert-to pdf` + `pdftoppm -r 150` from the live pptx, md5 against the bank | **PASS** — 0 px differ, md5 `01bcb967…` identical |
| crop-pair scale match | new `measure_attempt9/crop_currency_9.py` — re-cuts all 4 regions from render_9 + the original | **PASS** — all 4 byte-current, effective scale 2.0844×2.0833 on both axes |
| build determinism | rebuild into `scratch/tmp/w005_rebuild/` (output path redirected; script copied so relative `require`s resolve), zip-entry compare vs the deliverable | **PASS** — 48 entries, 1 differs (`docProps/core.xml`, timestamps only), 10/10 media identical, `slide1.xml` identical |
| house chrome | `shared_patterns/house_chrome_check.py` on render_9 | **PASS** |
| ink bands / phantom | new `measure_attempt9/adjudicate_9.py` (re-runnable adjudication fixture) | worst **3.64 px** (TOL 8), 0 px house-frame overflow |

### Adjudication numbers banked for the verdicts (to use, NOT to fabricate a verdict with)

These are the PIL facts I will measure any finding against — they are pre-flight
measurements, **not** a substitute for the judge, and I have written **no** verdict:

- **45 px phantom band (eq5) — REJECTED.** With `<3 ink px per column` treated as JPEG
  noise: ORIGINAL = 26 real glyph groups ending **x637**; render = 27 groups ending **x638**.
  Columns x639..x646 hold ZERO ink; x647..x683 hold 1 px/col; x689+ is the green box border.
  Any finding demanding eq5 extend to x683 should be **refuted** — that stretch adds
  ~45 px of arrow the original does not have.
- **getbest containment — the one real attempt-9 fix.** Original ink x196..500 ends 5 px
  inside the pink box's right border (x505..506); render_9 ink x196.7..499.9 (dx1 = -0.09 px).
  A finding claiming overflow here must be measured against the border on both images.
- **Font substitution — bounded, not a defect.** No installed face reproduces the original's
  (advance, ink-height) pair; DejaVu Sans 18 pt matches advance to 1 px but inks 3–5 px
  shorter vertically (worst band delta 3.64 px at rememberU dy1, within TOL 8). An
  unavoidable medium/font artifact, identical at any size preserving the advance.

## PARK STATE — gateway congestion (not a defect in the slide)

Per the fleet-confirmed gate reality and the standing law (`pgrep -c -f analyze_image.py`
≥ 8 ⇒ do NOT dispatch, heartbeat, sleep 240, re-probe, max TWO per hour, then park honestly):

- Measured queue: **19/19/22 → 27 → 26 → 17/17/17 → 15/16/16** analyzer procs across
  six samples between 16:39 and 17:15. The two allowed hourly re-probes
  (16:11→16:49 and 16:35→17:01, `sleep 240` + re-probe) both returned ≥ 8.
- **Both quotas consumed. NO leg was dispatched** — dispatching into this congestion would
  burn ~20 min per leg and return no verdict.
- **`visual_attempts` left at 0** — no vision call of mine ever started, so nothing is
  countable as an attempt. The previous lane also left it at 0.
- **`gen_status` left at `building`**, `visual_check`/`visual_transcript` left `null`.
  Nothing was certified because nothing was judged. **I did not fabricate any verdict.**
- The banked render/pptx are verified current and the slides' content is not in question:
  this is purely the fleet's vision gateway being wedged.

### DB row as parked (`get 5`)

`gen_status=building`, `pptx_path=videos/machine-learning/03_ridger_regression_gradient_descent/recreated_pptx/slide_005_recreated.pptx` (the one empty row, now filled — the file is confirmed at `58de0cb2…`), `visual_check=null`, `visual_attempts=0`, `visual_transcript=null`, `worker_id=w005-fresh-20261024` (released at the end of the lane).

### Exact resume commands

```bash
C=/workspaces/codespaces-blank/ai_llm_slides
Q="$C/videos/machine-learning/03_ridger_regression_gradient_descent/recreated_pptx/qa/slide005"
cd "$C" && VIDEO=machine-learning/03_ridger_regression_gradient_descent \
  python3 scripts/15_progress.py claim 5 w005-resume-<stamp>        # auto-takes-over if stale
bash "$Q/dispatch_attempt9/_gate_check.sh" 2>/dev/null || true       # if >=8, wait: don't dispatch
bash "$Q/dispatch_attempt9/leg_A_full_slide.sh"                     # Template A -> judge_attempt_9.txt
# then one at a time, gate-checking between each:
for r in eq_stack blue_upper pink_band lower_eqs; do
  bash "$Q/dispatch_attempt9/_gate_check.sh" && bash "$Q/dispatch_attempt9/leg_B_$r.sh"
done
```

Adjudicate every FAIL/MINOR PIL-first against `measure_attempt9/adjudicate_9.py` and the
numbers above, then certify with `set` (`no record-visual subcommand`):
`visual_check PASS`, `visual_transcript <full-slide transcript>`, `visual_attempts <n>`,
`gen_status passed`, `release`.

## Banked evidence (this lane)

- `dispatch_attempt9/verify_payloads.py` — payload round-trip checker (new)
- `measure_attempt9/adjudicate_9.py` — adjudication fixture (new)
- `measure_attempt9/crop_currency_9.py` — crop currency + scale audit (new)
- `scratch/tmp/w005_rebuild/` — redirected rebuild + its zip-compare evidence
- `dispatch_attempt9/leg_*.sh` — the 5 repaired scripts (payload bytes unchanged)

## Query budget (this lane)

Zero web queries. Slide 005's research leg is already `CONFIRMED` in `SOURCES_MAP.md`
(CS229 notes, fetched live), so the economy law's sibling-record check applied.

# Lane section — `w005-attempt9-resume-20261024` (2026-10-24 18:00 → 19:18Z)

## Resume state
- Claimed with `VIDEO=... python3 scripts/15_progress.py claim 5 w005-attempt9-resume-20261024`.
- Row was dependency-free (`deps`); no parent, no pattern gate.
- Build fix phase SKIPPED by law: the current deliverable/render currency was proven with a
  fresh LibreOffice render. No rebuild occurred and no certified component was edited in place.

## Local verification re-run by this lane (no vision calls)
- `qa/slide005/resume_local_verify_attempt9.txt` is banked.
- Fresh render: `scratch/tmp/w005_attempt9_fresh/slide-1.png` is byte-identical to
  `qa/slide005/render_9.png`; both md5 `01bcb967f29e502e99e80925aa320599`.
- Deliverable md5: `58de0cb2c39c5ef004e60d9f000a48a9`
  (`slide_005_recreated.pptx`).
- Build script md5: `6a65b1f67c4e30a27929281f02c1a214`.
- Payload byte-fidelity: all 5 attempt-9 payloads PASS against
  `shared_patterns/judge_protocol_03.md`.
- Crop-pair currency/scale: all 4 pairs current; matched effective scales ~2.083-2.086 per axis.
- House chrome: PASS.
- Pre-judge selfcheck remains `OVERALL SELFCHECK attempt 8: PASS`; worst ink-band deviation
  is `3.64` frame px against `TOL 8`.

## Late-landing-transcript re-glob (timeout kills observation, not files)
Re-globbed the entire bank at 19:00Z:
- No `judge_attempt_9.txt` exists.
- No `crop_9_*_judge.txt` exists.
- Existing `judge_attempt_6.txt` is the only real prior verdict and is stale/not attempt 9.
- No banked `FINAL VERDICT` belongs to attempt 9 or render_9.
- `visual_attempts` remains `0` because no vision leg was dispatched.

## Park state — gateway congestion, NOT a slide defect
Gate law was followed exactly before any vision call:
- 19:00Z probe: `analyzer_count=13` → `>=8`, do not dispatch.
- 19:04Z re-probe after heartbeat + sleep 240: `analyzer_count=11`.
- 19:11Z final allowed hourly re-probe after heartbeat + sleep 240: `analyzer_count=10`.
- Hourly two-probe quota consumed. No Template A leg and no Procedure B crop leg was dispatched.
- This follows the image-analysis routing/storm doctrine and the deck gate law; it is an honest
  park, not a fabricated verdict.

## Exact resume commands
```bash
cd "$PWD/ai_llm_slides"
export TMPDIR="$PWD/scratch/tmp"
Q="$PWD/videos/machine-learning/03_ridger_regression_gradient_descent/recreated_pptx/qa/slide005"
VIDEO=machine-learning/03_ridger_regression_gradient_descent python3 scripts/15_progress.py claim 5 w005-attempt9-resume-<stamp>
echo -n 'analyzer_count='; pgrep -c -f analyze_image.py || echo 0
bash "$Q/dispatch_attempt9/leg_A_full_slide.sh"
for r in eq_stack blue_upper pink_band lower_eqs; do
  echo -n 'analyzer_count='; pgrep -c -f analyze_image.py || echo 0
  bash "$Q/dispatch_attempt9/leg_B_$r.sh"
done
```

## Certification still required
`gen_status=passed` and `visual_check=PASS` must NOT be written yet. Certification requires:
1. Template A full-slide PASS from `judge_attempt_9.txt`; and
2. all four crop-pair legs clean or PIL-adjudicated in
   `crop_9_{eq_stack,blue_upper,pink_band,lower_eqs}_judge.txt`.

When both are real, use:

Use the actual count only if all five vision attempts are truly run; otherwise use the number of
actually dispatched judge legs.

# Lane section — `slide005-judge9-1024192313` (2026-10-24, PATIENT WAIT lane)

## Defining instruction
PATIENCE, not probing. A prior lane exhaustively verified the build and parked because the
vision gateway was congested. This lane's mandate was to WAIT for a genuine window
(`pgrep -c -f analyze_image.py` STRICTLY < 8, polled at most once per 10 min) and then fire
BOTH legs completely, rather than burning probes on congestion.

## Claim
- `VIDEO=machine-learning/03_ridger_regression_gradient_descent python3 scripts/15_progress.py claim 005 slide005-judge9-1024192313` → `claimed slide 5 by slide005-judge9-1024192313`.
- Heartbeats at claim and every ~10 min per the worker liveness contract; release at lane end.

## Non-vision verification re-run by this lane (nothing assumed; all reproduced)
| check | method | result |
|---|---|---|
| bank / payloads present | Glob over `recreated_pptx/qa/slide005/**` | all attempt-9 artifacts present |
| payload byte-fidelity | `dispatch_attempt9/verify_payloads.py` — round-trips all 5 `-p` payloads vs `shared_patterns/judge_protocol_03.md` | **PASS** — A 4115 B, B 1914 B ×4, exact |
| BLOC1ER/BLOC2ER corruption | grep -noE 'BLOC[0-9]ER' over protocol + 5 payloads + dispatch scripts | **BLOC1ER/BLOC2ER = 0**; only clean `BLOCKER` survives (payload A ×4, crop ×2 each ×4, protocol ×6) |
| `\bK\b` discipline | same grep + byte round-trip above | only `\bK\b`→9 substituted |
| deliverable currency | md5sum `slide_005_recreated.pptx` | `58de0cb2c39c5ef004e60d9f000a48a9` (matches verified prior state) |
| render currency | fresh `soffice --convert-to pdf` + `pdftoppm -png -r 150` from the live pptx, md5 vs bank | **IDENTICAL** — 0 px differ, md5 `01bcb967f29e502e99e80925aa320599`, 2001x1125 |
| house chrome | `shared_patterns/house_chrome_check.py render_9.png 005` | **PASS** (panel x112-1882 y94-bottom, L/R/bottom strokes, top bare, badge (1824,152) d=68) |
| pre-judge selfcheck | `measure_attempt9/selfcheck_005_final.py` | **PASS** (`OVERALL SELFCHECK attempt 8: PASS`), worst ink-band deviation 3.64 px vs TOL 8, 0 px house-frame overflow, all boxes contained |
| crop-pair currency | `measure_attempt9/crop_currency_9.py` | **ALL 4 PAIRS CURRENT + SCALE-MATCHED** |
| effective scale re-derivation | independent PIL re-derivation of `H_render/540` and per-pair `output_px/frame_px` on BOTH images | render 2001x1125 ⇒ `H_render/540 = 2.083333`, `W_render/960 = 2.084375`; per-pair render eff == orig eff per axis (2.0826..2.0865) ⇒ matched LANCZOS scale ~2.083x confirmed |

Conclusion of the non-vision phase: the build needs NO rebuild; the deliverable, the render,
the house chrome, the payloads and the crop pairs are all current and correct. The ONLY
outstanding item is the vision gate itself.

## DB state on entry
`get 005` → `gen_status=building`, `pptx_path=videos/machine-learning/03_ridger_regression_gradient_descent/recreated_pptx/slide_005_recreated.pptx`,
`visual_check=null`, `visual_attempts=0`, `visual_transcript=null`,
`worker_id=slide005-judge9-1024192313` (fresh claim). `last_error` carries the prior lane's
honest-park note (congestion), which is accurate and was not overwritten.

## Gateway observations (slow poll, one probe per ~10 min, no dispatch while >= 8)
