# Slide 050 worker report — w050-finish-20261024 (IN PROGRESS)

Deck: `machine-learning/03_ridger_regression_gradient_descent` ("Iteration 2", Perceptron)
Deliverable: `recreated_pptx/slide_050_recreated.pptx`
Build: `recreated_pptx/build/slide_050.js` (mtime 04:44) — pptx (04:45) IS current with it.
This lane RESUMED from the stale `w050-fix-20261024` / `worker-fresh-050` report (see the
prior report at this path, overwritten per runbook; its full text survives in
`adjudication.md`, `judge_attempt_2.txt`, `build_slide_050_pre_captionfix.js`,
render_1..4.png and all measurement scripts).

## State inherited (verified by this lane)

- Prior lane applied 4 measured fixes to build/slide_050.js (pre-fix copy banked at
  `build_slide_050_pre_captionfix.js`):
  1. L4 caption "C1 positive / C2 negative / Zero is unaccepted" added
     (x=240 y=106 w=280 h=20, fontSize 13, C1 red / C2 blue / Zero green / rest black);
  2. Z mini-table relocated to x641/664/686 (labels y=74, vector images y=86);
  3. "Check classes of" relocated to x=542 (measured ink x542..626 y86..96);
  4. caption-box title fontSize 12→10 (single line, like the original).
- render_4.png (04:45) was built from the current pptx; house_chrome_4 PASS;
  selfcheck_a_render4 has 1 FAIL (red-box ink zone) — PIL-adjudicated in
  `adjudication.md` as typed-vs-handwritten ink weight (ground rule c), not a defect.
- Template A verdict on render_2 (judge_attempt_2.txt, 01:51): FAIL, 1 BLOCKER
  (omitted L4 key caption) + 2 MINOR. Adjudication: BLOCKER CONFIRMED and FIXED;
  MINOR #2 fixed by the Z-table relocation; MINOR #3 REFUTED (navy border, no
  dark-red border exists in either image).
- Prior lane's attempt-4 Template A dispatches never landed a verdict (killed at the
  1700s outer wall after two 630s analyzer aborts). No crop judges were run.

## Work done by this lane (2026-10-24)

1. Claimed row 50 (`w050-finish-20261024`, --force over the stale heartbeat).
2. PIL re-verification of the BLOCKER vs the original
   (`verify_l4_caption_finish.py` run output):
   - Original L4 band x240..510 y110..124: ink present; C1 red (46 red px),
     C2 blue, "Zero" green (167 green px in band; 90/99 dark px green at x394..424),
     tail black. The original DOES display the caption — BLOCKER real.
   - render_4/render_5: same band carries the typed caption with all four color
     components (red 211, blue 208, green 375 px in wider band) — fix landed.
3. Re-rendered FRESH from the current pptx (soffice+pdftoppm, 150dpi,
   `scratch/tmp/w050f/`, private LO profile): 2001x1125.
   `cmp` proves `render_5.png` byte-identical to render_4 — the rebuild is
   deterministic and no doctoring occurred.
4. house_chrome_5.txt: PASS (banked).
5. Cut 6 fresh Procedure-B pairs from render_5 (`cut_crops_050_v5.py`):
   caption (x230..526 y98..134), mathzone (x240..722 y50..132), chart, tableeq,
   pinkbox, redstop — all at matched effective scale 2.08-2.09 (LANCZOS x2.0833 on
   the original crops). PIL sanity: caption pair shows the same red/blue/green mix
   in both images.
6. Banked judge payloads: `judge_payload_5.txt` (Template A, verbatim substring of
   shared_patterns/judge_protocol_03.md — byte-checked), `judge_payload_B_5.txt`
   (Template B, NNN→050 only — byte-checked), `judge_prompt_5.txt` (full command).

## In-progress: judge dispatch (attempt 5) — BLOCKED ON GATEWAY CONGESTION

Template A probe on render_5 hung at the 150s wall: fleet `pgrep -c -f
analyze_image.py` stayed 10-16 (16-slot gate saturated; sibling lanes slide047
attempt 6, slide010 and others active). Law: probe hang → heartbeat, sleep 240-300,
re-probe ONCE; before EACH vision call re-probe load, >=8 → heartbeat+sleep.

Remaining commands in order (all with TMPDIR=scratch/tmp; run one at a time):
1. probe: `scripts/16_vision_gate.sh timeout 150 python3
   .agents/skills/image-analysis/scripts/analyze_image.py analysis
   .../qa/slide050/render_5.png --view "Slide 050 recreation attempt 5 — probe"
   --capture "150dpi PNG render of a 13.33x7.5in PPTX" --timeout 120 --rounds 1
   --tries 1 --transcript .../qa/slide050/probe_5.txt`
2. Template A: `scripts/16_vision_gate.sh timeout 1700 python3
   .agents/skills/image-analysis/scripts/analyze_image.py comparison
   .../qa/slide050/render_5.png .../unique_slides/slide_050.jpg --view "Slide 050
   recreation — fidelity check vs original lecture frame" --capture "IMG1=150dpi PNG
   render of a 13.33x7.5in PPTX; IMG2=original lecture video frame" --thinking high
   --max-tokens 65536 --timeout 600 --rounds 1 --tries 1 --transcript
   .../qa/slide050/judge_attempt_5.txt -p "$(cat .../qa/slide050/judge_payload_5.txt)"`
3. Template B per crop (order: caption, mathzone, tableeq, chart, pinkbox, redstop):
   `scripts/16_vision_gate.sh timeout 1700 python3
   .agents/skills/image-analysis/scripts/analyze_image.py comparison
   .../qa/slide050/crop_5_NAME_render.png .../qa/slide050/crop_5_NAME_orig.png
   --view "Slide 050 zoomed crop NAME — render vs original at matched scale
   (attempt 5)" --capture "IMG1=zoomed crop of a 150dpi PPTX render; IMG2=the SAME
   slide-space region cropped from the original lecture frame and upscaled to match
   IMG1's effective scale" --thinking high --max-tokens 65536 --timeout 600
   --rounds 1 --tries 1 --transcript .../qa/slide050/crop_5_NAME_judge.txt
   -p "$(cat .../qa/slide050/judge_payload_B_5.txt)"`

Then: PIL-adjudicate every finding; if clean → certify
(`set 50 visual_check PASS --worker w050-finish-20261024`, `set 50 visual_transcript
.../judge_attempt_5.txt --worker w050-finish-20261024`, `set 50 gen_status passed
--worker w050-finish-20261024`, heartbeat, `release 50 w050-finish-20261024`),
re-read `get 50` (claim()/set() can reset gen_status — restore before release).

# UPDATE 2026-10-24 ~11:20 — w050-finish-20261024 (attempts 5→6)

## Attempt 5 (Template A on render_5): FAIL — adjudicated PIL-first
Full record: `adjudication.md` "Attempt 5 adjudication" section.
- **Finding 1 (BLOCKER): final-W truncated** — CONFIRMED + FIXED. Original shows
  W̲ = (5 / −1 / −1): construct ink x744..821 y69..133 (65pt; three digit sub-bands);
  vision transcription `orig_finalW_transcript.txt` reads all three components.
  The analysis JSON's 2-component read is wrong vs the frame. Fixed: eq_050_finalW.png
  re-rendered 3-component (600x308px), sidecar written (it was STALE — render_eq.py only
  prints sidecars; the stale 557x215 sidecar squeezed the new PNG to ~70% height in the
  first rebuild; caught by the pre-judge closed-loop measurement). Placed x744 y69;
  render_6 construct x746..815 y70..105, top edge 1pt from the original's y69.
- **Finding 2 (BLOCKER): "η = 1" missing** — REFUTED. PIL proves the original has NO
  η text: the zone right of "REPEAT using Step" (x538..645 y58..77) is uniform cream
  (L=251/252; zero ink at thr 450/600/726; ASCII map banked). Two vision reads
  (primed + neutral) hallucinated the phrase completion. Law: never fix a defect the
  original does not have. The prior lane's blue "η" PNG (matplotlib parsed "C00000" as
  tab:blue — verified) sat on the Initial-W stack's "−2" denominator and is REMOVED
  (extra element); "REPEAT using Step" already matches the original's extent x415..537.
- **Finding 3 (MINOR): six vs five class labels** — REFUTED. PIL counts SIX C-label
  clusters at 22.6pt pitch in both original tables. No change.
- **Finding 4 (MINOR): cursor "+" reproduced** — CONFIRMED per ground rule (c);
  removed from the build.

## Attempt 6 (render_6, current)
Build fixed (4 edits + corrected finalW sidecar); re-rendered fresh
(scratch/tmp/w050f6, 2001x1125); house_chrome_6 PASS; caption/eta/plus/finalW all
PIL-verified; crop_6_* pairs re-cut at matched scale; payloads banked
(judge_payload_6.txt / judge_payload_B_6.txt / judge_prompt_6.txt).
Template A on render_6 dispatched (`judge_attempt_6.txt`) — **in flight**.
Next after it lands: Template B crops in order caption, mathzone, pinkbox, tableeq,
chart, redstop (`run_crop_judges_5.sh` renamed usage — it reads crop_5_*; for attempt 6
call the same command shape with crop_6_<NAME> paths and judge_payload_B_6.txt).
PIL-adjudicate any new finding; on clean legs → certify:
`set 50 visual_check PASS --worker w050-finish-20261024`,
`set 50 visual_transcript .../judge_attempt_6.txt --worker w050-finish-20261024`,
`set 50 gen_status passed --worker w050-finish-20261024`, heartbeat,
`release 50 w050-finish-20261024`; re-read `get 50` (set() can reset gen_status —
restore before release). Attempts: 6 of 6 used after this round; if render_6 FAILs on a
real defect, park `gen_status=failed` with `last_error` per the runbook.

# PARK / HANDOFF 2026-10-24 11:58 — w050-finish-20261024 → w050-fixjudge-20261024-114323

State: **claim transferred** to `w050-fixjudge-20261024-114323` at 11:43:23 (my heartbeat
lapsed >40min during the 1700s-wall wait; the W4 retry command aborted at the refused
heartbeat and never dispatched). That lane re-rendered from MY fixed pptx:
`render_7.png` (11:51:27) is **byte-identical to render_6.png** (cmp-verified) — all
fixes below are live in the current deliverable.

## What is DONE (banked)
- Fix set applied to `build/slide_050.js` (pre-fix build banked `build_attempt_5.js`):
  1. finalW = 3-component `W̲ = (5 / −1 / −1)` (eq_050_finalW.png 600x308 @600dpi;
     sidecar written to disk — see WARNING below); placed x744 y69.
  2. Misplaced blue "η = 1" image REMOVED (the original has no η text — PIL-proven
     blank cream zone; see adjudication.md §Finding 2).
  3. Cursor artifact "+" REMOVED (ground rule c).
  4. L4 caption (BLOCKER from attempt 2) intact: red C1 / blue C2 / green Zero /
     black tail, ink y109.6..123.5 in a y106..126 box inside the navy box.
- render_6/render_7: house chrome PASS; equations present; containment verified.
- crop_6_* pairs cut from render_6 at matched effective scale (2.08–2.09) —
  **valid for render_7** (byte-identical rebuild; protocol's diff-proof is the
  `render_7 IDENTICAL to render_6` cmp above).
- Payloads banked: `judge_payload_6.txt` (Template A, verbatim substring of
  shared_patterns/judge_protocol_03.md), `judge_payload_B_6.txt` (Template B),
  `judge_prompt_6.txt`; `run_crop_judges_5.sh` dispatcher (edit K/NAME to reuse).

## WARNING — do not re-run render_050_eqs.py
The original `render_050_eqs.py` regenerates the OLD **2-component** finalW (would
revert fix 1), and `scripts/render_eq.py` only **PRINTS** sidecars — it never writes
them. The corrected 3-component PNG + written sidecar are already in
`build/assets/eq_050_finalW.{png,json}` (600x308, w_in 1.0, h_in 0.51333). Re-rendering
without rewriting the sidecar silently distorts the construct (measured ~70% vertical
squash). Leave assets as they are.

## Resume commands (for the claiming lane)
1. Template A: `scripts/16_vision_gate.sh timeout 1700 python3
   .agents/skills/image-analysis/scripts/analyze_image.py comparison
   .../qa/slide050/render_7.png .../unique_slides/slide_050.jpg --view "Slide 050
   recreation — fidelity check vs original lecture frame" --capture "IMG1=150dpi PNG
   render of a 13.33x7.5in PPTX; IMG2=original lecture video frame" --thinking high
   --max-tokens 65536 --timeout 600 --rounds 1 --tries 1 --transcript
   .../qa/slide050/judge_attempt_7.txt -p "$(cat .../qa/slide050/judge_payload_6.txt)"`
   (probe first if the gateway window needs opening; W4 one hard-wall retry allowed)
2. Template B crops (one at a time; gate law >=8 → heartbeat+sleep):
   caption, mathzone, pinkbox, tableeq, chart, redstop — the `crop_6_<NAME>_` pairs
   are valid for render_7 (identical bytes); bank transcripts as
   `crop_6_<NAME>_judge.txt` (or re-cut `crop_7_*` and rename).
3. PIL-adjudicate any finding against `unique_slides/slide_050.jpg` (see
   adjudication.md for the measured geometry bank).
4. On clean legs: `set 50 visual_check PASS --worker <id>`, `set 50 visual_transcript
   <transcript> --worker <id>`, `set 50 gen_status passed --worker <id>`, heartbeat,
   `release 50 <id>`; re-read `get 50` (set() can reset gen_status — restore before
   release).

## Attempt accounting
Attempts used: 5 (Template A FAIL on render_5 → 4 adjudicated findings → fixed) and 6
(render_6/render_7 built; its Template A dispatch died at the analyzer's 630s wall x2
+ the 1700s outer wall — no verdict banked; W4 retry never started due to the claim
transfer). The next Template A verdict on render_7 completes attempt 6; a rebuild after
a real defect would be attempt 7+ (the runbook's 6-attempt cap is exceeded only if the
fix didn't clear the defects — the founder's park rule applies).

# UPDATE 2026-10-24 12:00-13:10 — w050-fixjudge-20261024-114323 (TRIAGE + attempt 8)

## TRIAGE of the trail (done independently, PIL-first, both images)

Row 50 claimed --force over the stale `w050-finish-20261024` (86m stale heartbeat).
Deck: `.../03_ridger_regression_gradient_descent`, row 50 = "Iteration 2".

Fresh render of the CURRENT pptx (2001x1125 @150dpi, private LO profile, TMPDIR=scratch/tmp):
`render_7.png` — **byte-identical to banked render_6.png** (0 differing pixels), so the
prior lane's build was deterministic and un-doctored. house_chrome_7 PASS.

### adjudicated findings (full record: `qa/slide050/w7_adjudication.md`)

| trail item | verdict this lane |
|---|---|
| attempt_2 #1 BLOCKER (omitted L4 caption) | CONFIRMED FIXED — render carries C1/C2/Zero/is-unaccepted at x240..509 with red/blue/green/black; closed |
| attempt_5 #1 BLOCKER (W truncated) | **REFUTED — the original shows W = (5, −1) only (2 components). The prior lane's 3-component "fix" INVENTED content. REVERTED.** |
| attempt_5 #2 BLOCKER (η = 1 missing) | REFUTED — my own PIL: red "REPEAT using Step" terminates at x530; x531..642 is zero ink at every threshold; the 166 ink px in that zone are the Z₁Z₂Z₃ black label glyphs at x643..699. No η exists. Closed. |
| attempt_5 #3 MINOR (six vs five labels) | REFUTED — six C-clusters at 22.6px pitch in both tables (six columns x1..x6). Closed. |
| attempt_5 #4 MINOR (cursor "+") | CONFIRMED FIXED — render_8 has zero ink at x215..260 y405..425. Closed. |

**Evidence for the finalW revert** (banked `w7_pinkbox_ascii.txt`, full-res ASCII of the
original's pink box x743..827 y57..135, lum<205):
- TWO digit rows only: "5" at y68..83, "−1" at y119..133; ONE fraction bar at y106 (19 cols).
- LEFT paren x745..746 spans y61..134; RIGHT paren x786..787 spans y61..134.
- What the prior lane read as a "third component" is the construct's own RIGHT PAREN
  (x786..787), and the ink it attributed to a third digit row at y118..133 is the
  −1 denominator plus that same paren. There is no third stacked entry.
- The judge's OWN field reading in attempt_5 was "W = (5, −1)" — i.e. the judge also saw
  two; the prior lane over-corrected against its own judge.

### actions taken (copy-then-modify, never delete banked evidence)
1. `eq_050_finalW.png` re-rendered as `\underline{W}=\left(\substack{5\\-1}\right)`
   (13pt black, 557x215px @600dpi); sidecar `eq_050_finalW.json` **written to disk**
   (render_eq.py only PRINTS sidecars — a stale sidecar silently squeezes the PNG, the
   prior lane's own caught trap).
2. Prior 3-component assets preserved: `assets/eq_050_finalW.png.pre_w7_3comp`,
   `assets/eq_050_finalW.json.pre_w7_3comp`.
3. `build/slide_050.js` pre-revert copy: `qa/slide050/build_attempt_7_pre_finalW_revert.js`
   (no build edit needed — the sidecar drives geometry).
4. pptx rebuilt (12:19) → `recreated_pptx/slide_050_recreated.pptx`; `render_8.png` cut fresh.
5. render_7 vs render_8 diff = 2240 px confined to x745..815 y70..105 — ONLY the pink
   construct changed; nothing else moved.
6. house_chrome_8 PASS; zero render ink outside the gray panel.

## attempt 8 judge dispatch — IN FLIGHT
- `render_8.png` (2001x1125) is the judge input.
- Payloads banked + byte-checked: `judge_payload_8.txt` (Template A) and
  `judge_payload_B_8.txt` (Template B) are **md5-identical to the banked
  `judge_payload_6.txt` / `judge_payload_B_6.txt`** — no attempt-number token lives in the
  payload body, so byte-identity IS protocol compliance. Payload text derived by the
  protocol's only substitutions (NNN→050) from `shared_patterns/judge_protocol_03.md`.
- Six crop pairs cut for Template B, all at matched effective scale (≤0.08% mismatch),
  corr 0.83-0.93 (pinkbox 0.27 — expected, it is a near-empty box):
  `crop_8_{caption,mathzone,pinkbox,tableeq,chart,redstop}_{render,orig}.png`
- Template A dispatch: `scratch/tmp/w7_judge_A8.sh`, `--timeout 1200` under the
  orchestrator's provisional wall extension (049 precedent), outer `timeout 1700`.
  Launched 12:54:50 with pre-dispatch fleet load 45. **No FINAL VERDICT line yet** —
  still streaming (load rose to 43-54; the fleet is saturated by sibling lanes).
- Log: `scratch/tmp/w7_judge_A8.log`.

### next commands in order
1. poll for `judge_attempt_8.txt` (must contain a real `FINAL VERDICT:` line);
2. on verdict: PIL-adjudicate every finding (refute with the banked numbers above);
3. Template B per crop, order caption, pinkbox, mathzone, tableeq, chart, redstop:
```
cd "$R" && VIDEO="$D" python3 scripts/15_progress.py heartbeat 50 <worker>
scripts/16_vision_gate.sh timeout 1700 python3 .agents/skills/image-analysis/scripts/analyze_image.py comparison \
  "$QA/crop_8_<NAME>_render.png" "$QA/crop_8_<NAME>_orig.png" \
  --view "Slide 050 zoomed crop <NAME> — render vs original at matched scale (attempt 8)" \
  --capture "IMG1=zoomed crop of a 150dpi PPTX render; IMG2=the SAME slide-space region cropped from the original lecture frame and upscaled to match IMG1's effective scale; region: <desc>" \
  --thinking high --max-tokens 65536 --timeout 600 --rounds 1 --tries 1 \
  --transcript "$QA/crop_8_<NAME>_judge.txt" -p "$(cat "$QA/judge_payload_B_8.txt")"
```
4. on clean/adjudicated legs → certify per runbook and re-read `get 50` before release.

# UPDATE 2026-10-24 14:35-15:05 — w050-fixjudge2-20261024-134000 (RE-ANCHOR + PARK)

Row 50 reclaimed --force (`w050-fixjudge-20261024-114323` hb 59m stale — my own prior
lane; it had exhausted its max-two re-probes and was mid-park).

## Banked FAIL provenance (which build each FAIL scored — confirmed by md5 + render chain)
- `judge_attempt_2.txt` FAIL scored `render_2.png` (00:56) — the pre-captionfix build.
- `judge_attempt_5.txt` FAIL scored `render_5.png` (09:39) — prior lane's post-captionfix,
  pre-finalW-3comp build.
- CURRENT deliverable = `recreated_pptx/slide_050_recreated.pptx` md5
  **d2ce33ec10db6011f45361521cf7bb03**, rebuilt 12:19 → `render_8.png` md5
  **7265fa10ac17b96c78e4b07cfa6cabf1**. Both FAILs therefore PRE-DATE the current build
  and were correctly re-adjudicated, not simply refuted.

## What changed this lane (all copy-then-modify; no banked evidence deleted)
1. `assets/eq_050_finalW.png` re-rendered as `\underline{W}=\left(\substack{5\\-1}\right)`
   (2 components), 13pt black, 557x215px @600dpi, md5 `620bf144eaee1aeca11941d6c07ca124`.
2. `assets/eq_050_finalW.json` sidecar WRITTEN to disk (md5 `b9792c5f...`). __pycache__ /
   render_eq.py only PRINTS sidecars — the prior lane's caught trap.
3. Prior 3-component assets preserved as `.pre_w7_3comp` in `build/assets/`.
4. `build/slide_050.js` untouched this lane (md5 `b9da2078...` == my banked
   `build_attempt_7_pre_finalW_revert.js`); the revert was sidecar-driven only.
5. `render_7.png` was byte-identical to banked `render_6.png` (md5
   `04d2882c...`), proving the prior build was deterministic before I changed anything.
6. render_7 vs render_8 diff: 2240 px confined to x745..815 y70..105 — ONLY the pink
   construct moved; nothing else shifted.

## Adjudication outcomes (full detail: `w7_adjudication.md`, `w7_final_pil_table.txt`)
| FAIL item | outcome |
|---|---|
| attempt_2 #1 BLOCKER (omitted L4 caption) | CONFIRMED FIXED — render carries it at x240..498 y109..123 with red/blue/green/black. Closed. |
| attempt_5 #1 BLOCKER (W truncated) | **REFUTED — original shows W = (5, −1), TWO components. The prior lane's 3-component "fix" invented content the original lacks (`w7_pinkbox_ascii.txt`: exactly two digit rows y68..83 / y119..133, ONE bar y106; the "third component" is the construct's own right paren at x786..787). REVERTED.** |
| attempt_5 #2 BLOCKER (η = 1 missing) | REFUTED — my own PIL (`w7_eta2.py`): red "REPEAT using Step" terminates at x530; x531..642 has ZERO ink at lum<210/200/190/175/160; the 166 ink px in the wider zone are the Z₁Z₂Z₃ black labels at x643..699. No η in the original. Closed. |
| attempt_5 #3 MINOR (six vs five labels) | REFUTED — six C-clusters at 22.6px pitch in both tables (six columns x1..x6). Closed. |
| attempt_5 #4 MINOR (cursor "+") | CONFIRMED FIXED — render has ZERO ink at x215..260 y405..425. Closed. |

Final PIL table (`w7_final_pil_table.txt`): every contested region matches the original in
position/structure; the only divergences are typed-vs-handwritten ink weight
(L4 caption 270→257 px wide; heading ink counts 4-5x) which are ground-rule (d) MINORs.
house_chrome_8: PASS. Zero render ink outside the gray panel.

## Vision legs — BLOCKED, NOT FAILED (no verdict exists to adjudicate)
Fleet/gateway state observed (matches the banked 043 "GATE REALITY" evidence):
- 13:18 Template A (`--timeout 1200`, outer 1700): HangError abort at 1230s hard wall, 0/1 results.
- 13:18 one sanctioned hard-wall retry: HTTP 504 `upstream_timeout` (NVIDIA upstream), 0/1 results.
- 14:41 re-anchor probe: HangError abort at 180s (load 10).
- 14:49 re-probe 1: HangError abort at 180s (load 6 — under gate, still hanging).
- 14:56 re-probe 2 (max-two budget exhausted): HTTP 504 `upstream_timeout`, 0/1 results.

**No `FINAL VERDICT:` line was ever produced, so no verdict was fabricated and nothing was
certified.** The image leg is dying on the shared gateway, not on slide 050's content —
text is healthy but I did not use it, per law. Max two re-probes are exhausted → PARK.

`row 50 is parked as `gen_status=building` (NOT released, NOT passed) with a live heartbeat.
